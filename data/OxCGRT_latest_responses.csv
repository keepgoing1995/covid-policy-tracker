This hierarchy organised into six groups is expected to be updated throughout the pandemic, as the situation develops and more evidence and resources (e.g. new vaccines) become available: Group 1 includes people living in care and nursing homes, people aged 80 years and older, staff working in health care settings with particularly high risk of exposure (e.g. A&E, staff caring for COVID-19 patients), staff in health care setting in close contact with groups at particularly high risk (e.g. Haemato-oncology, transplant medicine), care workers in domiciliary and residential long-term care for older people and others working in care and nursing homes in contact with residents. It is estimated that this group amounts to 8.6 million people.[3] Group 2 includes people aged 75 to 79 years, staff in medical care settings with high risk of exposure, people with dementia and mental disabilities living in residential care settings, people working domiciliary and residential care with people with dementia or people with mental disabilities as well as people living with Down-Syndrome. This group includes an estimated 7 million people.[4] Group 3 covers approximately 5.7 million people[5] and includes those aged 70 to 74 years, people who have had an organ transplant; people with pre-existing conditions and who are at high risk, people living in sheltered accommodation/refuges and staff; close contacts of pregnant women; close contacts/family carers of people at high risk; staff at moderate risk of exposure in health care settings and in positions relevant to maintaining hospital infrastructure; parts of the public health authorities. Group 4 (approximately 4.9 million people[6]) consists of those aged 65 to 69 years; people with pre-existing conditions who are at moderate risk and their closest contacts, staff working in health care settings with low risk of exposure, teachers, educators, people in precarious work or living situations. People aged 60 to 64 years, staff in key local and federal government positions, people working in retail; people required to maintain public security with heightened risk of exposure and people working in critical infrastructure fall into Group 5 (about 8.4 million people[7]). The final group consists of the remaining population aged younger than 60 years (approximately 45 million people[8]). https://archive.vn/VR2fb"

Among other things the plan aims to ensure food and pharmaceutical security, promote a favorable business climate, and foster high value added sectors and international trade and FDI. A supplementary finance law (SFL) was enacted on June 4. It includes provisions amounting to 70bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this includes 3.7bn for medical supplies, 16.5bn for bonus payments to health workers, and 8.9bn for the health sector’s development. For the economic impact, the law includes 20bn for allowances to the unemployed because of COVID, and 11.5bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL plans for a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law. In response to the economic impact on household and enterprises of the lockdown measures, the authorities also announced that: (i) the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises have been postponed except for large enterprises; and (ii) contractual deadlines would be relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts would be suspended.    I recorded this as a 1(narrow) because it includes only tax exemption and nothing else like utilities    Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20210215151708/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"

The scheme will come into force on 1 November.'  “It has been demonstrated by countries in the region that unemployment and wage protection benefits are essential in responding to the economic shocks caused by COVID-19. The new scheme will provide much needed support to workers whose income earnings are at risk with the current pandemic and related economic crisis,” Pellerano continued.  The new scheme will provide temporary income support to insured Omanis who lost their employment involuntarily and who seek to become reemployed.   The new scheme will provide temporary income support to insured Omanis who lost their employment involuntarily and who seek to become reemployed. It will be the first ever scheme in Oman to cover all Omani workers, be they in the private, public, military or security sectors, under one fund, and the benefit will be linked with active labour market policies. Unemployed insured Omanis will be entitled to receive benefits upon the first claim, provided that they have been affiliated with the scheme for 12 consecutive months - or for 12 non- consecutive months over a period of 36 months - prior to unemployment. However, this entitlement condition will be waived for the first year of the scheme.     Benefits will be paid monthly for six consecutive or non-consecutive months and amount to 60 per cent of the average salary paid during the 24 months prior to unemployment, provided that the value of the benefit shall not be less than the minimum pension provided in the social security law.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210411212435/https://www.ilo.org/beirut/media-centre/news/WCMS_758289/lang--en/index.htm"
