Among other things the plan aims to ensure food and pharmaceutical security, promote a favorable business climate, and foster high value added sectors and international trade and FDI. A supplementary finance law (SFL) was enacted on June 4. It includes provisions amounting to 70bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this includes 3.7bn for medical supplies, 16.5bn for bonus payments to health workers, and 8.9bn for the health sector’s development. For the economic impact, the law includes 20bn for allowances to the unemployed because of COVID, and 11.5bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL plans for a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law. In response to the economic impact on household and enterprises of the lockdown measures, the authorities also announced that: (i) the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises have been postponed except for large enterprises; and (ii) contractual deadlines would be relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts would be suspended.
