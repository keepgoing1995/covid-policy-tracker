Here it is the rectors' offices, course heads and other management bodies who autonomously determine what happens at their university.""    COVID guidelines define four operating modes for universities or colleges.  The four risk levels of the Ministry of Health's corona traffic light - level 1 - low risk (green), level 2 - moderate-medium risk (yellow), level 3 - high risk (orange) and level 4 - very high risk (red).  The university or college modes: presence mode (green), dual mode (yellow), hybrid mode (orange) and distance mode (red). The operating modes do not always have to correlate with the risk levels. So there can be a moderate-medium risk and a university can still opt for hybrid or distance operation.     Some in-person courses are running where it is necessary for the course to take place. For example, an Ordinance of the Rectorate on the participation in face-to-face courses and face-to-face exams at the Art University Linz was released on the 26 April stipulating requirements for proving a negative test or a recovered status to access the university buildings (including studios and workshops) and take part in face-to-face classes.

Israel,ISR,20211111,20220206,C4: Restrictions on gatherings,3,1,"Knesset press release reporting on changes to gathering restrictions?  The Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, chaired by MK Gilad Kariv (Labor), convened on Thursday and approved the regulations under the new plan that went into effect on Tuesday (November 9). According to the plan, groups of tourists (numbering 5–40 members) who have received two vaccinations will be permitted to enter Israel even if more than six months have passed since the date of the [second] vaccination, if they meet a series of conditions, including the stipulation that the members of the group must come from countries classified by the Ministry of Health as “green"" or “yellow.""     The committee also approved regulations easing restrictions on gatherings in open spaces and cancelling the Green Pass requirement in low-risk locations. The regulations, which are due to go into effect on Thursday night at midnight, state that culture, sports and prayer sit-down events numbering up to 1,000 people can be held in open spaces without a Green Pass requirement. In closed halls, the maximum occupancy will increase from 400 to 600 participants, under Green Pass rules. Open-air venues will be permitted to hold outdoor events without occupancy limits, under Green Pass rules.    The Times of Israel reporting on the changes to gathering restrictions  With Israel apparently exiting its fourth wave of coronavirus infection, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz announced Tuesday that they have agreed to end capacity limits on outdoor gatherings, as well as scrapping “Green Pass” restrictions on some events.    The new regulations are subject to approval by the coronavirus cabinet, which is expected to hold a telephone vote on Tuesday evening. The changes also need the go-ahead from the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee before they can come into effect from Thursday.    According to the Tuesday statement by the premier and health minister, there will no longer be restrictions on the number of participants at outdoor gatherings.    Additionally, it will now be permitted to hold outdoor cultural, sports, or prayer events with up to 1,000 seated participants without requiring that attendees hold a Green Pass. For indoor events, the threshold will be 100 seated participants.    The Green Pass grants access to public venues for those who are either inoculated against the coronavirus, or have recovered from it, or have recently tested negative.

New Zealand,NZL,20200529,20200607,C4: Restrictions on gatherings,2,1,"Friday 29 May 2020. Amendments to Alert Level 2 —  part of the gradual easing of restrictions that will happen as we move towards Alert Level 1.    ""Social gatherings can be held with up to 100 people    The limit for social gatherings will be lifted to 100 people. These include events at home and outside of home like religious services, parties, weddings, tangihanga and funerals. It is important everyone keeps playing it safe.    This means: While hospitality businesses continue to have the 100 person limit per defined space, group bookings of more than 10 people will be permitted, but the 3 S’s — seated, separated, single-server — still apply. A funeral or tangihanga will also have a 100 person limit, and organisers are no longer required to apply to the Ministry of Health to hold one. Social gatherings at a private dwelling will be able to have a maximum of 100 people. A business or responsible individual, in charge of a social gathering, must ensure records are kept for contact tracing purposes, except where every person in a gathering knows each other. This includes in your home, community hall, or other such space. Participating in community sport will also become easier, with greater numbers of people able to gather up to a limit of 100 people. Requirements for contact tracing still remain. Workers providing a service to a social gathering, such as waiters at a wedding, are not included in the 100 person limit.""    /web/20200602033409/https://covid19.govt.nz/latest-updates/alert-level-2-changes-confirmed-for-friday-29-may/"

Movement around the country, and most other restrictions and legal requirements on businesses, services and individuals have been relaxed.    COVID-19 is still uncontrolled overseas, so we must continue to be vigilant. Businesses and services adopting good public health practices will support our defence against the virus re-emerging.    Public health guidelines   The requirement for businesses to display the official NZ COVID Tracer QR codes applies across all Alert Levels, including Alert Level 1. Businesses are also encouraged to adopt the following public health guidelines.          Advise people with possible COVID-19 symptoms that they should not enter the workplace or other premises.  Enable good health, hygiene and safety practices.  Display the official QR codes to enable people to keep track of their movements with the NZ COVID Tracer app.  Encourage physical distancing where practical.  While the risk of Covid-19 in New Zealand is currently very low, businesses and services that are open at Alert Level 1 need to be alert and respond appropriately if COVID-19 cases emerge while operating. If a COVID-19 case is linked to a business or service, they are expected to fully and rapidly comply with requests for information or actions to assist contact tracing and management (eg, cleaning, temporarily closing or other measures).    Under each of the four public health guidelines are recommended measures that businesses and services can take to enable them to operate safely.
