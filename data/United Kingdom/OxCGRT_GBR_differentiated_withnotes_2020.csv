Scottish, Northern Ireland, and Wales governments all were advising that where possible, people should work from home prior. So therefore all 4 countries recommend staying home, these advisories were made by individual governments, not by NAT GOV for the whole of UK, hence coded as 0.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201004232124/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/22/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus     https://web.archive.org/web/20201005123912/https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-lockdown-rules-four-nations-uk  ",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,2.00,,,2.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,403551,41825,0.00,37.04,37.04,37.04,37.04,37.04,37.04,37.04,37.04,40.62,40.62,40.62,40.62,40.62,40.62,40.62,40.62,32.14,32.14,32.14,32.14,32.14,32.14,32.14,32.14,100.00,100.00

This should be implemented as soon as care homes have planned and prepared to do so safely. Local oversight boards can give support and advice to help implement this safely. Updates include (all with safety and infection prevention recommendations to be in place):    Indoor visiting to up to four hours.  Outdoor visiting to up to one hour, with up to six visitors from up to two households.  Children and young people can also be supported to attend.  Increased flexibility around the circumstances and definition of essential visiting, to include visits to prevent or respond to a decline in residents’ health and wellbeing, to help with communication and distress and in end of life care.  Children and young people can be supported to attend essential visits.  No upper time limit for essential visits.  Changes to the designated visitor and circumstances when these should be supported.  Support for touch, and greater involvement with daily routine, to happen safely.  Spiritual and faith representatives supported to visit indoors and outdoors, at all stages of the pandemic, and not regarded as ‘designated visitors’.  Hairdressers supported to visit care homes.  Selected gifts and resident belongings can be brought in.  Arrangements for pets and therapets to be brought in safely.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210101193759/https://www.careinspectorate.com/index.php/coronavirus-professionals/information-for-people-experiencing-care",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42645,2550,0.00,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,65.10,65.10,65.10,65.10,65.10,65.10,65.10,65.10,60.12,60.12,60.12,60.12,60.12,60.12,60.12,60.12,100.00,100.00

However, to be crystal clear, wearing a face covering does not replace the need for social distancing or washing your hands regularly.    “Further scientific evidence is needed on the benefits to the wider public of wearing face coverings, but observational findings so far suggest that homemade or purchased 3 layer face-coverings might reduce transmission from one person to another if made, worn, handled and disposed of properly.    “Therefore, on balance, we are recommending to the people of Wales that 3 layer face-coverings should be used in situations where social distancing measures can be more difficult to achieve, for example, on public transport. We are not recommending their use outdoors.    “The wearing of face coverings will not be mandatory, but we will encourage people to do this for the benefit of themselves and others.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20201005051938/https://gov.wales/3-layer-face-coverings-recommended-not-mandatory-certain-situations-wales",0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15173,1410,0.00,77.78,77.78,77.78,77.78,77.78,77.78,77.78,77.78,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,70.83,70.83,70.83,70.83,70.83,70.83,70.83,70.83,100.00,100.00
