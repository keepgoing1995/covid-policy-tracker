The statutory measures provide for a statutory right to defer payments that are to be made in the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 on the basis of a consumer credit agreement. This means that if necessary, flat-rate installments (installments including principal and interest payments), capital repayments or interest payments can be suspended (deferred) for 10 months in full.    The deferral means that the payments owed in the deferral period will be postponed to future dates. The law provides that the deferred 10 months are added to the agreed term of the loan agreement - the term of the loan is extended by 10 months. However, instead of extending the term, borrowers can also agree with the bank that the deferred installments will be made up later.     Since the right to deferment was laid down in law, banks are not allowed to charge any charges (processing fee) for the deferral.    The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible.

Here it is the rectors' offices, course heads and other management bodies who autonomously determine what happens at their university.""    COVID guidelines define four operating modes for universities or colleges.  The four risk levels of the Ministry of Health's corona traffic light - level 1 - low risk (green), level 2 - moderate-medium risk (yellow), level 3 - high risk (orange) and level 4 - very high risk (red).  The university or college modes: presence mode (green), dual mode (yellow), hybrid mode (orange) and distance mode (red). The operating modes do not always have to correlate with the risk levels. So there can be a moderate-medium risk and a university can still opt for hybrid or distance operation.     Some in-person courses are running where it is necessary for the course to take place. For example, an Ordinance of the Rectorate on the participation in face-to-face courses and face-to-face exams at the Art University Linz was released on the 26 April stipulating requirements for proving a negative test or a recovered status to access the university buildings (including studios and workshops) and take part in face-to-face classes.

The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to 20 June inclusive.    Other COVID-19 entry regulations  The amended entry regulation brings the 3-G rule instead of quarantine for numerous countries and is initially valid up to and including 06/30/2021.      The entry regulation provides for three categories:    1. Entry from countries with a low incidence of infection (Appendix A): 3-G rule, no quarantine  These states are summarized in Appendix A; Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    A current 3-G certificate is required for entry. If this cannot be presented, a test must be performed immediately, but in any case within 24 hours. A document issued in German or English ( e.g. yellow vaccination certificate) about a vaccination that has been approved by the EMA or has successfully passed the EUL process of the WHO counts as proof of vaccination . A medical or official confirmation ( e.g.Separation notice) in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past six months. Proof of neutralizing antibodies is equivalent to the recovery certificate, which may not be more than 3 months old when entering the country.    The following countries are currently on Annex A:  Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Principality of Liechtenstein, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Poland , Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Czech Republic, Hungary, Vatican, Cyprus.    2. Entry from risk countries (Annex B1): 3-G rule, test with quarantine  When entering from high-incidence states, a 3-G certificate must be presented. If no evidence is provided, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours.    Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to enter quarantine when entering from risk countries, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    There is currently no country on the list of these countries .    3. Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2): PCR test and quarantine  Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2, currently United Kingdom, Brazil, India and South Africa) is only possible to a very limited extent as before. In essence, only Austrian citizens and persons with residence or habitual abode in Austria are allowed to enter. Entry for humanitarian reasons or in the urgent interest of the republic is also possible.    For people who come from a virus variant area or who have stayed in one in the past ten days, the following applies as before: Entry is only possible with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR ). The obligation to test also applies to vaccinated and recovered people. Austrians and people residing in Austria who have been in a virus variant state in the past 10 days are allowed to enter the country, but must have one within 24 hours Imitate the PCR test. This is controlled by the health authorities.    The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to June 20th inclusive.    The entry of other countries , which are found neither in Annex A, B1 or B2 is strictly prohibited and possible previously only in exceptional cases - such as for work or study purposes. In any case, a 3-G proof must be provided upon entry. Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to go into quarantine upon entry, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    The exceptions for commuters remain unchanged and still do not apply to entry from virus variant areas.    Children from 10 years of age must be tested, including the immunity level of the parents or the authorized supervisors. The quarantine obligation generally also applies to children, but does not apply if the parents or authorized supervisors are exempt from quarantine.    In principle, electronic registration using the pre-travel clearance form is currently required before each entry . This must be done 72 hours before entry at the earliest; commuters must renew it every 28 days.

Austria,AUT,20210618,C8: International travel controls,3,,"The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to June 20th inclusive.    COVID-19 Entry Regulation  The amended entry regulation brings the 3-G rule instead of quarantine for numerous countries and is initially valid up to and including 06/30/2021 . The entry regulation provides for three categories:    1. Entry from countries with a low incidence of infection (Appendix A): 3-G rule, no quarantine  These states are summarized in Appendix A; Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    Current 3G proof is required for entry. If this cannot be presented, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours. A document issued in German or English ( e.g. yellow vaccination certificate) about a vaccination that has been approved by the EMA or has successfully passed the EUL process of the WHO counts as proof of vaccination . A medical or official confirmation ( e.g.Separation notice) in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past six months. Proof of neutralizing antibodies is equivalent to the recovery certificate, which may not be more than 3 months old when entering the country.    The following states are currently on Annex A:  Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Principality of Liechtenstein, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Poland , Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Czech Republic, Hungary, Vatican, Cyprus.    2. Entry from risk countries (Annex B1): 3-G rule, test with quarantine  When entering from high-incidence states, a 3-G certificate must be presented. If no evidence is provided, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours.    Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to enter quarantine when entering from risk countries, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    There is currently no country on the list of these countries .    3. Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2): PCR test and quarantine    Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2, currently United Kingdom, Brazil, India and South Africa) is only possible to a very limited extent as before.     Essentially, only Austrian citizens and people with residence or habitual abode in Austria are allowed to enter. Entry for humanitarian reasons or in the urgent interest of the republic is also possible.    For people who come from a virus variant area or who have stayed in one in the past ten days, the following applies as before: Entry is only possible with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR ). The obligation to test also applies to vaccinated and recovered people. Austrians and people residing in Austria who have been in a virus variant state in the past 10 days are allowed to enter the country, but must have one within 24 hours Imitate the PCR test. This is controlled by the health authorities.    The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to June 20th inclusive.    The entry of other countries , which are found neither in Annex A, B1 or B2 is strictly prohibited and possible previously only in exceptional cases - such as for work or study purposes. In any case, a 3-G proof must be provided upon entry. Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to go into quarantine when entering the country, but tested people do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    The exceptions for commuters remain unchanged and still do not apply to entry from virus variant areas.  Children from 10 years of age must be tested, including the immunity level of the parents or the authorized supervisors. The quarantine obligation generally also applies to children, but does not apply if the parents or authorized supervisors are exempt from quarantine.    In principle, electronic registration using the pre-travel clearance form is currently required before each entry . This must be done 72 hours before entry at the earliest; commuters must renew it every 28 days. The compulsory registration does not apply when entering from a country listed in Appendix A if a 3G proof can be presented upon entry.

Austria,AUT,20211214,C1: School closing,2,0,"Educational area  For extracurricular youth education, youth work and supervised holiday camps, the rules of the get-togethers apply. In addition, the following applies:    Individuals may participate with a 2.5G certificate  A maximum of four supervisors per group of 25 participants is permitted.  If it can be made credible that a negative PCR test cannot be presented due to lack of availability, an evaluation that is not timely or due to the unpredictability of the business activity to be performed, operators may exceptionally allow people in even if they have 3G evidence submit. This also applies to operators.  For elementary educational institutions, institutions for out-of-school childcare and child minders, there is an obligation to provide evidence of a negative PCR test twice a week. The test must not have been carried out more than 72 hours ago.     The schools are open to everyone who needs them. It is mandatory to wear a mask in the entire school building, as well as in class and group rooms. If students are in the school building and do not have 2G evidence, antigen or PCR tests must be carried out at least twice a week. However, these must be carried out so often that valid evidence must be presented for each day of the teaching week.    For further binding regulations see  COVID-19 School Ordinance 2021/22  and its  amendments   as well as  COVID-19 Higher Education Act .    From week 38, the Corona Commission will determine the epidemiological risk for the educational institutions per federal state. On the basis of this classification, the Education Directorate determines the risk level for the federal state in agreement with the central office by ordinance. The responsible education directorate then informs the schools. Defined framework conditions also enable flexible measures to be taken at the school location. Further information can be found on the website of the  Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF).

Austria,AUT,20211224,H7: Vaccination policy,5,1,"Wiener Zeitung article on booster and additional fourth vaccinations for certain groups.    The National Vaccination Board (NIG) reacted to the threatened rapid spread of the Omikron variant of the coronavirus and updated its recommendations on Thursday evening. In addition to the general recommendation to increase the vaccination rate with the third bite as quickly as possible, it is also about the fourth vaccination. The NIG does not generally recommend this, but it should be offered in the high-risk and system-critical area from six months after the third stitch.    That would affect the particularly exposed health workers.

Austria,AUT,20220401,H2: Testing policy,3,,"Change in testing strategy as of 1 April 2022.  The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month.    **New guidelines**  Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to    quickly if necessary .    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.     The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing.

A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.  For all additional tests, the chargeable test offer in Austria can be used.    At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.    The adjusted test strategy will come into effect on April 1st and will initially be valid until June 30th.

Austria,AUT,20220404,C1: School closing,2,0,"How are the current, far-reaching easing of restrictions affecting university and college operations?  Not directly. Because the universities and colleges remain exempt from the general health law requirements and thus also from the current Corona Basic Measures Ordinance . However, they offer an important orientation for the individual and independent definition of those corona measures that the universities and colleges take independently and independently within the framework of their autonomy. These vary from university to university and from college to college.    This is also the reason why universities and colleges currently have different forms of access regulations (2.5G, 3G regulation or none at all) depending on their situation-specific requirements and why the handling of a mask requirement is quite different. In view of the general lifting of most restrictions, universities and colleges are also considering whether they should relax their corona measures even further, while also monitoring the epidemiological situation. In any case, the recommendation to wear an FFP2 mask in closed rooms remains.

Austria,AUT,20220416,H2: Testing policy,3,,"Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to quickly if necessary.    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: Against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    1.	Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.   The first point of contact for symptomatic people remains 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    2.	Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for companions and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      3.	Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month :  0.	5 PCR tests: starting April 1st.  1.	5 antigen tests: available from pharmacies.  2.	A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.    For all additional tests, you can use the chargeable test offer in Austria.  At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.  The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.

Austria,AUT,20220416,H3: Contact tracing,2,,"Contact management  In view of the currently very high number of cases, many employers are currently facing the challenge that many people are falling ill at the same time or are in quarantine as contact persons. In order to counteract this burden, there is a change in the procedure for isolating  contact persons . They are now subject to a traffic restriction for 10 days.    No contact persons are:  •	People if FFP 2 masks were worn on both sides during contact,  •	Persons with 3 immunological events ( e.g. 3 vaccinations),  •	Children up to 12 years of age with 2 immunological events, or  •	People who have recovered within the last 3 months (omicron recoveries).     Traffic Restriction:  •	Wearing an  FFP 2 mask  or a higher-quality mask when in contact with other people, even within private living areas,  •	No visits to facilities with vulnerable people or risky settings ( e.g. retirement homes, health facilities),  •	No entry into facilities  or no exercise of activities where  an FFP 2 mask  or an MNS is not worn  continuously  (catering establishments, fitness clubs , etc. ),  •	No attendance of major events and the like (sporting events, concerts, etc.)    Visiting the place of work  is generally possible, provided that the continuous wearing of an  FFP 2 mask and compliance with suitable protective measures can be guaranteed.

Austria,AUT,20220516,H2: Testing policy,3,,"Test strategy  Austria is broadly positioned in terms of testing the population and has been able to establish a secure, functioning and nationwide test network. In order to be prepared for the coming challenges, the basic features of this test system should be retained. This means that new developments such as new virus variants can be reacted to quickly if necessary.    At the same time, Austria is currently facing changed framework conditions due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, the Austrian test strategy - as a key pillar of pandemic management - is being adapted to the current situation: against the background of higher immunity in the population, tests should now be used primarily where they are needed. Also, anyone who needs a test will get one! This means that tests for symptomatic people as well as tests for residents, visitors and employees of vulnerable areas will continue to be available free of charge and without restrictions.    Starting in April, the Austrian test strategy consists of three different test tracks. Funding will be provided by the federal government, but implementation and organization will remain the responsibility of the federal states, as has been the case up to now.    1. Symptomatic Individuals : Tests for symptomatic individuals will remain in place as usual. This means that the tests are still available free of charge and without restrictions for this group of people.     The first point of contact for people with symptoms is still 1450. The exact implementation is carried out by the individual federal states, which is why the process for those affected can vary from federal state to federal state.    2. Vulnerable Settings : The new test regulation defines vulnerable areas, for whose residents, visitors and employees as well as for accompanying persons and external service providers unlimited and free tests will continue to be available.  Here, too, implementation is carried out by the federal states.      3. Tests of the general public (""mass testing"") : The adjustment of the test strategy affects the previously free mass testing. In the future, 5 free PCR and 5 free antigen tests will be available to every citizen per month:  	o	5 PCR tests: starting April 1st.  	o	5 antigen tests: available from pharmacies.  	o	A temporary solution is provided for self-tests purchased before April 1st: Each person can have a total of 10 PCR tests evaluated by April 30th.    For all additional tests, the chargeable test offer in Austria can be used.    At the same time, wastewater monitoring will play a greater role in the future in order to be able to reliably and long-term monitor the course of the pandemic.    The adjusted test strategy came into effect on April 1st and is initially valid until June 30th.    Sources:  https://archive.ph/UbxYM  https://archive.ph/OYeVj"

Tests can be performed either in the HMO clinics or the ""Test and Go"" (Drive-In) sites.     PCR tests for coronavirus are a national resource, and allocation of tests is carried out according to national prioritization.

By law, you must notify the Ministry of Health that you are entering quarantine through the online form or by calling the Ministry of Health hotline at *5400.    In early August, the Israel Defense Forces was formally tasked with “cutting the chain of infections” for the country — finding and testing those suspected of having contracted the disease and putting them into quarantine. This included taking responsibility for the country’s testing efforts and conducting epidemiological surveys: the practice of speaking with confirmed carriers to retrace their steps in the days following their infection to identify and warn those they may have unwittingly passed the disease on to.  Public health experts have identified this type of contact tracing as crucial in curbing the spread of the virus, as it allows authorities to locate people who may have contracted the disease before they have a chance to pass it on.    By November 1, the military plans to have over 2,000 soldiers performing contact tracing, at a rate of roughly two investigations per day, according to an officer from the unit, Lt. Col. Raviv Hadar.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201110061007/https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-contact-tracing-unit-overwhelmed-by-recent-outbreak-but-improving/  "

Women who gave birth in recent months and are still entitled to unemployment benefits will be paid at a rate matching their last paid salary, an increase from the regular stipend they have received thus far.    National Insurance Institute director-general Meir Spiegler told Channel 12 news that the proposed plan “is balanced, gradual and provides a solution for quite a few populations that have fallen into crisis and have not yet found the ability to enter the labor market.”    “This framework is not a perfect framework,” he said, but it “provides the maximum response to populations that are genuinely in trouble and that currently have no solution.”    Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20210702192745/https://www.timesofisrael.com/benefits-end-for-those-made-jobless-by-covid-as-double-vote-causes-knesset-fury/"

Israel,ISR,20220307,C1: School closing,2,1,"PCR test required for attendance in schools participating in the educational shield programme ('Magen Hinuch') - will only do one quick home test a week, as long as they continue to do a weekly PCR test at school on a regular basis.    Studies and education  Guidelines regarding the education system, classes and children    Checking and learning  The ""examiners and learners"" outline is intended to allow for as continuous a study routine as possible for male and female students. In this framework, all students in kindergartens and first to sixth grades will do two home speed tests, which will be checked twice a week, and if the result is negative and there are no symptoms, they will be able to go to schools and kindergartens and educational institutions. Students in grades 7-12 will not do tests twice a week, but will fill out a form twice a week that they have no symptoms, and will be able to get to school.    For whom the outline is intended  The outline is intended for students up to the age of 18 in these educational institutions: kindergartens, nurseries, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, yeshivas and boarding schools.    How the outline works  Boys and girls in kindergartens and grades one through six - the tests will be done at home on Sundays and Wednesdays in the morning before arrival on the school day, or the evening before the arrival on the school day.    The results of the tests must be reported on the Ministry of Education portal.    •	If the result is negative, and there is no fever of 38 degrees or more, cough or difficulty breathing - it is possible to get to school or kindergarten (unless there is a verified person living with them at home).  •	If the result is positive - a supervised rapid test should be done.  If the result of the supervised test is negative - it is possible to return to school or kindergarten.  If the supervised test is positive - enter at least 5 days of isolation, and follow the instructions for the verified Corona..    Students in grades 7-12 - there is no need to do home tests as part of the outline. Students will fill out a form on Sunday and Wednesday for no symptoms (fever of 38 degrees or more, cough or difficulty breathing), and no verified person living with them at home - and can come to school.    Pupils in the schools that participate in 'Magen Hinuch' - will only do one quick home test a week, as long as they continue to do a weekly PCR test at school on a regular basis.    Home test kits will be distributed to all male and female students, free of charge.    What to do in case of close contact with verified Corona:  •	Pupils in kindergartens and grades one through six who have been in close contact with Verified to Corona and have been checked on Sundays and Wednesdays, and no Verified who lives with them - will no longer have to go into isolation.  •	Students in seventh to twelfth grades who have filled out a form stating that they have no symptoms on Sundays and Wednesdays and have no verified person living with them - will not have to go into isolation.  •	Pupils in kindergartens and grades one through six, who are not vaccinated or recovering, who have not been tested on Sundays and Wednesdays and whose test results have not been reported on the Ministry of Education portal - will have to go into full isolation in case they are exposed to corona  verification .  •	Students in seventh to twelfth grades, unvaccinated and not recovering, who did not fill out the absence of symptoms form on Sunday and Wednesday - will have to go into full isolation in case they are exposed to verification to Corona (  isolation can be shortened from the 5th day).  •	In case of direct exposure and close to verified (in class or in the afternoon) - it is recommended to be checked daily for 5 days from the date of exposure.  •	If one of the male or female members of the student's household is verified for corona - neither vaccinated nor recovering will enter full isolation (  isolation can be shortened  starting from the 5th day).    Please note: The count of isolation days begins on the last day of contact with the verified person. If there is no separation in the house between the verified person and the other members of the household - the counting of the isolation days will begin from the day the verified person recovers.    What to do if there are symptoms:  •	Students who have a fever of 38 degrees or more - will do a PCR test or a supervised rapid test and remain in isolation until a negative result is obtained in this test, or until 48 hours have passed with a fever of less than 37.5 degrees without antipyretics.  •	Pupils who have a cough or difficulty breathing - it is recommended that they do a corona test and stay at home and do a home test. Stay home until the symptoms go away.    Those who are exempt from performing the tests  •	Recovers - Exempt from performing home tests for 60 days from the date of recovery.  •	Special education - Students in special education frameworks are exempt from performing speed tests twice a week.    A student who is in a risk group for a serious illness or one of the members of their nuclear family is in a risk group - will be allowed not to attend school in the coming month.    What about teaching staff  The outline of tests in the education system does not apply to teaching staff. Teaching men and women who have not been vaccinated and have not recovered will continue to undergo a supervised rapid examination twice a week, and in case of close contact with a verified person will enter full isolation (with the possibility of shortening isolation from the 5th day).

New Zealand,NZL,20200611,E1: Income support,2,0,"Background. As of June 4, New Zealand had 1,504 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, and 22 deaths. On March 25, 2020, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4 restrictions after domestic transmission of the virus was found. The authorities declared a state of emergency and implemented strong containment measures including the closure of all non-essential businesses, cancellation of all events and gatherings, closure of schools, and cancellation of discretionary domestic air travel. This followed the closure of all borders and entry ports to non-residents on 19 March with returning citizens and residents required to self-isolate, and since 10 April to enter into two weeks of supervised quarantine. New Zealand’s economy was strongly affected by the decline in Chinese tourists in the first quarter (usually the high season due to Chinese New Year). In addition, merchandise exports to China declined in the first quarter of the year by 12 percent compared with the last quarter of 2019.    Reopening of the economy. The country moved to Alert Level 2 on May 14, lifting lock-down restrictions and maintaining social distancing in public and for private gatherings of more than 10 people, and 50 people for funerals. Schools reopened fully on 18 May, while bars reopened on May 21. Businesses re-opened with health and social distancing requirements, and domestic travel has been allowed. The borders remain closed to all but New Zealand residents, who must isolate in dedicated facilities for 14 days upon entry. The country had previously moved to Alert Level 3 from Alert Level 4 on April 28, allowing many businesses to re-open, though without physical contact to customers, and schools to re-open with limited capacity. People have been encouraged to continue to stay and work from home if possible. With almost no remaining active COVID-19 cases, cabinet is considering to move to Alert Level 1 on June 8, which would imply few remaining domestic restrictions but continued border closure.      Key Policy Responses as of June 4, 2020    FISCAL  With the FY2020-21 budget and previous fiscal packages, the government has announced fiscal measures amounting to a total of NZ$62.1 billion (21.3 percent of GDP) through FY2023-24, of which NZ$20.5 billion will be disbursed by end-June. The total amount includes the NZ$50 billion COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, a majority of which is yet to be allocated to specific spending programs. Already specified fiscal measures include: (i) healthcare-related spending to reinforce capacity (NZ$0.5 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (ii) a permanent increase in social spending to protect vulnerable people (total NZ$2.4 billion or 0.8 percent of GDP); (iii) a lump sum 12-week wage subsidy to support employers severely affected by the impact of COVID-19 (NZ$15.2 billion or 5.2 percent of GDP); (iv) income relief payment to support people who lost their jobs (NZ$3.1 billion or 1 percent of GDP); (v) a permanent change in business taxes to help cashflow (NZ$2.8 billion or 1.0 percent of GDP); (vi) infrastructure investment (NZ$3 billion or 1 percent of GDP); (vii) a temporary tax loss carry-back scheme (NZ$3.1 billion or 1.1 percent of GDP); and (viii) support for the aviation sector (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP). The government has also approved a NZ$0.9 billion debt funding agreement (convertible to equity) with Air New Zealand to ensure continued freight operations, domestic flights and limited international flights. The New Zealand government also provides loans of up to NZ$100,000 to small businesses that employ 50 or less employees. In addition, on March 28 the government announced temporary removal of tariffs on all medical and hygiene imports needed for the COVID-19 response.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200618135750/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"
New Zealand,NZL,20200611,E2: Debt/contract relief,1,,"MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept the official cash rate (OCR) unchanged at 0.25 percent on May 13 and signaled its intention to keep the OCR at this level for at least a year. The OCR was reduced by 75 basis points to 0.25 percent on March 17. The RBNZ has also announced a near doubling of the Large-Scale Asset Purchase program (LSAP) to purchase government bonds and Local Government Funding Agency (LGFA) in the secondary market up to $60 billion over the next 12 months. The RBNZ has doubled the overdraft on the crown settlement account to NZ$10 billion for April-June to meet the government's short-term cash needs.    The RBNZ has been providing liquidity in the FX swap market and re-established a temporary US dollar swap line (US$30 billion) with the U.S. Federal Reserve. The RBNZ has established a new Term Auction Facility (TAF), which allows banks access to collateralized loans of up to 12 months, and announced a corporate facility in which the RBNZ will offer up to NZ$500 million per week in open market operations with banks against corporate paper and asset-backed securities for 3 months. The RBNZ also introduced a Term Lending Facility (TLF), a longer-term funding scheme for banks at 0.25 percent for up to 3 years duration, available to use for six months from May 26. Access to the TLF is linked to each banks’ lending under the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme (see below) and will require approved eligible collateral. The RBNZ has reduced bank’s core funding ratio requirement to 50 percent from 75 percent to help banks make credit available.    To further support the stability of the financial system, the start date for a regulatory change requiring higher capital for banks has been postponed for 12 months, to July 2021 (to support up to about NZ$47 billion of additional lending), with other regulatory initiatives in the pipeline also put on hold for at least six months. The RNBZ has also agreed with the banks that during this period there will be no dividend payments on ordinary shares and redemption of non-CET1 capital instruments. The RBNZ has removed, effective as of May 1, mortgage loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions for the next 12 months.    The New Zealand government, the RBNZ, and the New Zealand Bankers Association have also announced a number of financial measures to support SMEs and homeowners. These include six-month principal and interest repayment deferrals to mortgage holders and SMEs affected by COVID-19 and a NZ$6.25 billion Business Finance Guarantee Scheme for SME loans, in which the government covers 80 percent of the credit risk.    Other related measures taken by the government that could contribute to financial stability include a six-month freeze on residential rent increases and increased protections for tenants for termination of tenancies. The government has also committed to a temporary law change to enable businesses to put existing debt into hibernation for six months.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200618135750/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19"
