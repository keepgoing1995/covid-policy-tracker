This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,401413,3338,72.26,64.81,64.81,45.37,45.37,55.09,55.09,50.76,50.76,61.46,61.46,50.52,50.52,55.99,55.99,53.55,53.55,64.88,64.88,52.38,52.38,58.63,58.63,55.85,55.85,37.50,37.50

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,505539,3634,74.25,60.19,60.19,40.74,40.74,50.47,50.47,45.75,45.75,58.85,58.85,47.92,47.92,53.38,53.38,50.73,50.73,61.90,61.90,49.40,49.40,55.65,55.65,52.62,52.62,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,505539,3634,74.25,60.19,60.19,40.74,40.74,50.47,50.47,45.75,45.75,58.85,58.85,47.92,47.92,53.38,53.38,50.73,50.73,61.90,61.90,49.40,49.40,55.65,55.65,52.62,52.62,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT    This appears to be ending on March 12 2022. ",1.00,"Policy continues:     Jan 12, 2022: Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, the Honourable Mary Ng, announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing.    This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,524975,3898,75.19,39.81,39.81,20.37,20.37,30.09,30.09,25.19,25.19,45.83,45.83,34.90,34.90,40.37,40.37,37.61,37.61,47.02,47.02,34.52,34.52,40.77,40.77,37.62,37.62,37.50,37.50

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,536166,4044,75.78,35.19,35.19,15.74,15.74,25.47,25.47,20.45,20.45,41.67,41.67,30.73,30.73,36.20,36.20,33.38,33.38,44.05,44.05,31.55,31.55,37.80,37.80,34.58,34.58,25.00,25.00

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,"Chief Medical Officer still makes weekly updates and advice on COVID-19. keeping this at a level 2 for now.     https://archive.ph/xfM6x",1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,565052,4252,72.97,35.19,35.19,15.74,15.74,25.47,25.47,21.00,21.00,41.67,41.67,30.73,30.73,36.20,36.20,33.69,33.69,44.05,44.05,31.55,31.55,37.80,37.80,34.93,34.93,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,578291,4452,76.37,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,18.48,18.48,40.63,40.63,29.69,29.69,35.16,35.16,32.28,32.28,42.86,42.86,30.36,30.36,36.61,36.61,33.31,33.31,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,279448,2439,78.65,70.37,70.37,41.67,41.67,56.02,56.02,47.80,47.80,65.10,65.10,46.88,46.88,55.99,55.99,50.77,50.77,69.05,69.05,48.21,48.21,58.63,58.63,52.66,52.66,37.50,37.50

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

Unless you qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller, you cannot enter Canada for reasons such as:  spending time at a seasonal home or cottage  visiting an immediate or extended family member, if age 18 or over  attending a Canadian educational institution as an international student if age 18 or over  childcare for your relatives  a personal or casual visit  air or rail crew, medical worker, transportation, or sports  tourism, fishing, entertainment or leisure    Fully vaccinated travellers:   Options for providing proof of a valid pre-entry test  All travellers 5 years of age or older must provide proof of one of the following accepted types of test results:    Starting February 28: proof of a professionally administered or observed antigen test taken outside of Canada no more than 1 day before your scheduled flight or entry to Canada by land or water  the one day window does not depend on the time of day the test was taken or the time of your flight or entry  for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave or you enter by land any time on Friday, you could provide proof of a negative result from an antigen test taken any time on Thursday, or on Friday  it must be administered or observed by a pharmacy, laboratory, healthcare entity or telehealth service  the test must be authorized for sale or distribution in Canada or in the jurisdiction in which it was obtained  the test must be performed outside of Canada  Proof of a valid negative molecular test taken within 72 hours of your scheduled flight’s departure time to Canada or your entry to Canada by land or water  for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave at 11:00 am on Friday, your test must have been taken any time after 10:59 am on Tuesday  Previous positive molecular test result: you no longer have symptoms and provide proof of a positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before entering Canada. Counting starts the day after your test.  for example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, then January 11 would be the earliest scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada, or the first day you could use it to enter Canada by land or water  if your positive proof is accepted you won’t have to take arrival or Day-8 tests  a positive antigen test result is never a valid test result for boarding a flight or entry to Canada and can’t be used as proof of a previous infection  End of short trip exemption: the pre-entry testing exemption for trips 72 hours or less ended on December 21, 2021.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,347729,2851,81.77,66.67,66.67,37.96,37.96,52.31,52.31,43.19,43.19,63.02,63.02,44.79,44.79,53.90,53.90,48.11,48.11,66.67,66.67,45.83,45.83,56.25,56.25,49.63,49.63,37.50,37.50

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,3.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,355299,2983,82.73,55.56,55.56,13.89,13.89,34.73,34.73,21.09,21.09,54.69,54.69,29.17,29.17,41.93,41.93,33.58,33.58,58.93,58.93,29.76,29.76,44.35,44.35,34.80,34.80,25.00,25.00

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,365577,3226,79.12,40.74,40.74,13.89,13.89,27.32,27.32,19.50,19.50,42.19,42.19,25.00,25.00,33.60,33.60,28.59,28.59,44.64,44.64,25.00,25.00,34.82,34.82,29.10,29.10,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,370559,3469,83.38,40.74,40.74,13.89,13.89,27.32,27.32,18.35,18.35,42.19,42.19,25.00,25.00,33.60,33.60,27.86,27.86,44.64,44.64,25.00,25.00,34.82,34.82,28.26,28.26,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,373336,3682,79.12,40.74,40.74,13.89,13.89,27.32,27.32,19.50,19.50,42.19,42.19,25.00,25.00,33.60,33.60,28.59,28.59,44.64,44.64,25.00,25.00,34.82,34.82,29.10,29.10,25.00,25.00

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated. Proof must be submitted at the time of application  All members will be required to complete an ArriveCAN submission for each trip  RABC permit holders can’t use their permit to enter Canada if they have tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 10 days or have symptoms of COVID-19. Returning residents must present themselves at the nearest CBSA port of entry  Permit holders entering Canada are exempt from mandatory randomized testing    https://archive.ph/4RZks",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,29.63,29.63,13.89,13.89,21.76,21.76,,,29.69,29.69,18.75,18.75,24.22,24.22,,,30.36,30.36,17.86,17.86,24.11,24.11,,,25.00,25.00

All testing for air travellers, for both those who qualify as fully vaccinated and partially or unvaccinated people, will be completed outside of airports, either via an in-person appointment at select testing provider locations and pharmacies, or a virtual appointment for a self-swab test. Travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, unless exempt, must continue to test on Day 1 and Day 8 of their mandatory 14-day quarantine.    Moving testing outside of airports will support testing for travellers arriving by air while still being able to monitor and quickly respond to new variants of concern, or changes to the epidemiological situation. Mandatory random testing continues at land border points of entry, with no changes.    Border testing is an important tool in Canada's detection and surveillance of COVID-19 and has been essential in helping us slow the spread of the virus. Data from the testing program are used to understand the current level and trends of importation of COVID-19 into Canada. In addition, these data have and continue to inform the Government of Canada's safe easing of border measures.    Air travellers who qualify as fully vaccinated and who are selected for mandatory random testing, as well as air travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, will receive an email notification within 15 minutes of completing their customs declaration. The email will contain information to help them arrange for their test with a testing provider in their region. Unvaccinated travellers can complete their tests by a virtual appointment or an in-person appointment with the test provider at their store or at select pharmacies and still respect their quarantine requirements.    All travellers must continue to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours before their arrival in Canada, and/or before boarding a cruise ship destined for Canada, with few exceptions. It is the fastest, easiest and most secure way for travellers to show they meet public health requirements. Additional efforts are being undertaken to enhance compliance with ArriveCAN, which is already over 95% for travellers arriving by land and air combined.    All vaccinated travellers who are randomly selected for the border testing surveillance program must complete arrival mandatory testing requirements.    If your arrival test result is positive, you must go into isolation and follow the federal requirement to isolate for 10 days from the date of the test result. Your 10-day isolation is required, even if the isolation requirement is shorter in your province or territory.    Mandatory random testing and information in the ArriveCAN app are necessary tools that help inform public health advice to protect the health and safety of Canadians.    https://archive.ph/rMHRg",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,,,25.52,25.52,20.83,20.83,23.17,23.17,,,25.60,25.60,20.24,20.24,22.92,22.92,,,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,94850,1408,75.11,71.30,71.30,50.93,50.93,61.12,61.12,56.00,56.00,71.35,71.35,59.90,59.90,65.62,65.62,62.75,62.75,76.19,76.19,63.10,63.10,69.65,69.65,66.36,66.36,37.50,37.50

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,122632,1585,77.42,67.59,67.59,47.22,47.22,57.40,57.40,51.82,51.82,69.27,69.27,57.81,57.81,63.54,63.54,60.40,60.40,73.81,73.81,60.71,60.71,67.26,67.26,63.67,63.67,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,122632,1585,77.42,67.59,67.59,47.22,47.22,57.40,57.40,51.82,51.82,69.27,69.27,57.81,57.81,63.54,63.54,60.40,60.40,73.81,73.81,60.71,60.71,67.26,67.26,63.67,63.67,37.50,37.50

For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,141973,1819,75.94,37.04,37.04,17.59,17.59,27.32,27.32,22.27,22.27,40.62,40.62,29.69,29.69,35.15,35.15,32.32,32.32,42.86,42.86,30.36,30.36,36.61,36.61,33.37,33.37,25.00,25.00

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,30602,258,81.07,67.59,67.59,38.89,38.89,53.24,53.24,44.32,44.32,67.19,67.19,48.96,48.96,58.08,58.08,52.41,52.41,71.43,71.43,50.60,50.60,61.01,61.01,54.54,54.54,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,30602,258,81.07,67.59,67.59,38.89,38.89,53.24,53.24,44.32,44.32,67.19,67.19,48.96,48.96,58.08,58.08,52.41,52.41,71.43,71.43,50.60,50.60,61.01,61.01,54.54,54.54,37.50,37.50

To protect our supply of POCT, please only use them if you have symptoms …If you have a positive POCT result, you are required to isolate regardless of your vaccination status. The length of your isolation period will differ depending on your vaccination status… If you have COVID-19 symptoms, are between the ages of 2 and 50 and are otherwise healthy, you should register online to get your POCT test kit. If you have a positive test, you need to report it online. Do not test again. If you have a negative rapid POCT test and your symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, test again…A PCR test is conducted by a health professional at an assessment centre. PCR tests are available if you: Are over 50 or are under 2 (24 months); Live /work in a hospital, long-term care facility, correctional facility, shelter or is precariously housed; Are immunocompromised; Are pregnant”.

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT    This appears to be ending on March 12 2022. ",1.00,"Policy continues:     Jan 12, 2022: Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, the Honourable Mary Ng, announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing.    This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,36417,301,82.75,58.33,58.33,38.89,38.89,48.61,48.61,42.24,42.24,57.81,57.81,46.87,46.87,52.34,52.34,48.76,48.76,60.71,60.71,48.21,48.21,54.46,54.46,50.37,50.37,37.50,37.50

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,48197,349,83.30,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.14,17.14,40.62,40.62,29.69,29.69,35.15,35.15,31.52,31.52,42.86,42.86,30.36,30.36,36.61,36.61,32.45,32.45,25.00,25.00

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,"Chief Medical Officer still makes weekly updates and advice on COVID-19. keeping this at a level 2 for now.     https://archive.ph/xfM6x",2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,62148,399,79.63,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.85,17.85,40.62,40.62,29.69,29.69,35.15,35.15,31.92,31.92,42.86,42.86,30.36,30.36,36.61,36.61,32.91,32.91,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,66816,422,79.63,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.85,17.85,40.62,40.62,29.69,29.69,35.15,35.15,31.92,31.92,42.86,42.86,30.36,30.36,36.61,36.61,32.91,32.91,25.00,25.00

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated. Proof must be submitted at the time of application  All members will be required to complete an ArriveCAN submission for each trip  RABC permit holders can’t use their permit to enter Canada if they have tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 10 days or have symptoms of COVID-19. Returning residents must present themselves at the nearest CBSA port of entry  Permit holders entering Canada are exempt from mandatory randomized testing    https://archive.ph/4RZks",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,,,28.12,28.12,23.44,23.44,25.78,25.78,,,28.57,28.57,23.21,23.21,25.89,25.89,,,25.00,25.00

To qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller to Canada, travellers must have been vaccinated with a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine accepted by the Government of Canada for the purpose of travel at least 14 calendar days before entering Canada.    All testing for air travellers, for both those who qualify as fully vaccinated and partially or unvaccinated people, will be completed outside of airports, either via an in-person appointment at select testing provider locations and pharmacies, or a virtual appointment for a self-swab test. Travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, unless exempt, must continue to test on Day 1 and Day 8 of their mandatory 14-day quarantine.    Moving testing outside of airports will support testing for travellers arriving by air while still being able to monitor and quickly respond to new variants of concern, or changes to the epidemiological situation. Mandatory random testing continues at land border points of entry, with no changes.    Border testing is an important tool in Canada's detection and surveillance of COVID-19 and has been essential in helping us slow the spread of the virus. Data from the testing program are used to understand the current level and trends of importation of COVID-19 into Canada. In addition, these data have and continue to inform the Government of Canada's safe easing of border measures.    Air travellers who qualify as fully vaccinated and who are selected for mandatory random testing, as well as air travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, will receive an email notification within 15 minutes of completing their customs declaration. The email will contain information to help them arrange for their test with a testing provider in their region. Unvaccinated travellers can complete their tests by a virtual appointment or an in-person appointment with the test provider at their store or at select pharmacies and still respect their quarantine requirements.    All travellers must continue to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours before their arrival in Canada, and/or before boarding a cruise ship destined for Canada, with few exceptions. It is the fastest, easiest and most secure way for travellers to show they meet public health requirements. Additional efforts are being undertaken to enhance compliance with ArriveCAN, which is already over 95% for travellers arriving by land and air combined.    All vaccinated travellers who are randomly selected for the border testing surveillance program must complete arrival mandatory testing requirements.    If your arrival test result is positive, you must go into isolation and follow the federal requirement to isolate for 10 days from the date of the test result. Your 10-day isolation is required, even if the isolation requirement is shorter in your province or territory.    Mandatory random testing and information in the ArriveCAN app are necessary tools that help inform public health advice to protect the health and safety of Canadians.    https://archive.ph/rMHRg",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,"On 19 july 2022, in the province of New Brunswick (NB): “Everyone aged five or older is eligible to get vaccinated.” NB recommends second booster doses for “First Nations, Metis and Inuit individuals aged 12 and over; Healthy individuals between 18 years old and over (previously 50 and over); All residents of long-term care facilities aged 18 and over; Individuals who are moderately to severely immunocompromised”.

As of 13 Jan. 2022, NL is reporting that 489,978 residents (94% of NL’s total population) had received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. 449,775 (86% of total population) have received two required doses. “You must be at least five years of age at the time of your vaccine. For those ages 12 to 29 years, your second dose appointment should be scheduled at least eight weeks after your first dose. For those 30 years and over, there should be a minimum of 28 days and up to four months between your first and second doses. Emerging evidence suggests that a longer interval between the first and second dose of a primary series results in a stronger immune response and higher vaccine effectiveness and may also be associated with a lower risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in adolescents and young adults. For children ages 5 to 11 years, your second dose appointment must be scheduled at least eight weeks and up to four months after the first dose. Booster doses are available for all individuals ages 18 years and older when at least 22 weeks has passed since completion of your primary series, which is two doses of vaccine… Moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals aged 30 years and older should be immunized with a third dose … at least 28 days after the last dose of COVID-19 vaccine”.

As of 25 Jan. 2022, NL is reporting that 494,134 residents (95% of NL’s total population) had received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. 454,481 (87% of total population) have received two required doses. Newfoundland has a higher vaccination rate than any other Canadian province or territory. “You must be at least five years of age at the time of your vaccine. For those ages 12 to 29 years, your second dose appointment should be scheduled at least eight weeks after your first dose. For those 30 years and over, there should be a minimum of 28 days and up to four months between your first and second doses. Emerging evidence suggests that a longer interval between the first and second dose of a primary series results in a stronger immune response and higher vaccine effectiveness and may also be associated with a lower risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in adolescents and young adults. For children ages 5 to 11 years, your second dose appointment must be scheduled at least eight weeks and up to four months after the first dose. Booster doses are available for all individuals ages 18 years and older when at least 22 weeks has passed since completion of your primary series, which is two doses of vaccine… Moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals aged 30 years and older should be immunized with a third dose … at least 28 days after the last dose of COVID-19 vaccine”.

Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,18464,46,88.99,73.15,73.15,57.41,57.41,65.28,65.28,59.14,59.14,68.23,68.23,57.29,57.29,62.76,62.76,58.49,58.49,72.62,72.62,60.12,60.12,66.37,66.37,61.50,61.50,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,18464,46,88.99,73.15,73.15,57.41,57.41,65.28,65.28,59.14,59.14,68.23,68.23,57.29,57.29,62.76,62.76,58.49,58.49,72.62,72.62,60.12,60.12,66.37,66.37,61.50,61.50,37.50,37.50

As of 10 feb. 2022, NL is reporting that 496,552 residents (95% of NL’s total population) had received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. 465,392 (just under 90% of total population) have received two required doses. Newfoundland has a higher vaccination rate than any other Canadian province or territory. “You must be at least five years of age at the time of your vaccine. For those ages 12 to 29 years, your second dose appointment should be scheduled at least eight weeks after your first dose. For those 30 years and over, there should be a minimum of 28 days and up to four months between your first and second doses. Emerging evidence suggests that a longer interval between the first and second dose of a primary series results in a stronger immune response and higher vaccine effectiveness and may also be associated with a lower risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in adolescents and young adults. For children ages 5 to 11 years, your second dose appointment must be scheduled at least eight weeks and up to four months after the first dose. Booster doses are available for all individuals ages 18 years and older when at least 22 weeks has passed since completion of your primary series, which is two doses of vaccine… Moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals aged 30 years and older should be immunized with a third dose … at least 28 days after the last dose of COVID-19 vaccine”.

NL is reporting that 497,890 residents (over 95% of NL’s total population) had received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. 465,392 (just under 91% of total population) have received two required doses. Newfoundland has a higher vaccination rate than any other Canadian province or territory. “You must be at least five years of age at the time of your vaccine. For those ages 12 to 29 years, your second dose appointment should be scheduled at least eight weeks after your first dose. For those 30 years and over, there should be a minimum of 28 days and up to four months between your first and second doses. Emerging evidence suggests that a longer interval between the first and second dose of a primary series results in a stronger immune response and higher vaccine effectiveness and may also be associated with a lower risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in adolescents and young adults. For children ages 5 to 11 years, your second dose appointment must be scheduled at least eight weeks after your first dose. Booster doses are available for all individuals ages 18 years and older, and individuals aged 12 to 17 years at higher risk of severe outcomes, when at least 22 weeks has passed since completion of your primary series.… Moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals aged 30 years and older should be immunized with a third dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna). Individuals in the 12 to 29 year age group may be offered the Moderna Spikevax vaccine (100 mcg)... Third dose appointments should be scheduled at least 28 days after the last dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Moderately to severely immunocompromised children aged 5-11 years should receive a three dose primary series of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine (10 mcg) if they have not yet been immunized, using an interval of 4 to 8 weeks between each dose… Immunocompromised individuals can be offered a booster dose when at least 22 weeks has passed since they received their third dose, meaning they will have a total of four doses.”.

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     Unless you qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller, you cannot enter Canada for reasons such as:  spending time at a seasonal home or cottage  visiting an immediate or extended family member, if age 18 or over  attending a Canadian educational institution as an international student if age 18 or over  childcare for your relatives  a personal or casual visit  air or rail crew, medical worker, transportation, or sports  tourism, fishing, entertainment or leisure    Fully vaccinated travellers:   Options for providing proof of a valid pre-entry test  All travellers 5 years of age or older must provide proof of one of the following accepted types of test results:    Starting February 28: proof of a professionally administered or observed antigen test taken outside of Canada no more than 1 day before your scheduled flight or entry to Canada by land or water  the one day window does not depend on the time of day the test was taken or the time of your flight or entry  for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave or you enter by land any time on Friday, you could provide proof of a negative result from an antigen test taken any time on Thursday, or on Friday  it must be administered or observed by a pharmacy, laboratory, healthcare entity or telehealth service  the test must be authorized for sale or distribution in Canada or in the jurisdiction in which it was obtained  the test must be performed outside of Canada  Proof of a valid negative molecular test taken within 72 hours of your scheduled flight’s departure time to Canada or your entry to Canada by land or water  for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave at 11:00 am on Friday, your test must have been taken any time after 10:59 am on Tuesday  Previous positive molecular test result: you no longer have symptoms and provide proof of a positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before entering Canada. Counting starts the day after your test.  for example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, then January 11 would be the earliest scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada, or the first day you could use it to enter Canada by land or water  if your positive proof is accepted you won’t have to take arrival or Day-8 tests  a positive antigen test result is never a valid test result for boarding a flight or entry to Canada and can’t be used as proof of a previous infection  End of short trip exemption: the pre-entry testing exemption for trips 72 hours or less ended on December 21, 2021.

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT    This appears to be ending on March 12 2022. ",1.00,"Policy continues:     Jan 12, 2022: Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, the Honourable Mary Ng, announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing.    This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,3.00,0,3.00,0,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,23443,64,91.06,73.15,73.15,40.74,40.74,56.94,56.94,43.64,43.64,68.23,68.23,48.96,48.96,58.60,58.60,50.68,50.68,72.62,72.62,50.60,50.60,61.61,61.61,52.57,52.57,37.50,37.50

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.

All students and bus drivers must wear a mask on school buses”. At Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), NL’s only university and largest post-secondary institution: “Masks will continue to be required indoors in public spaces and common areas, classrooms and laboratories… Students, staff and faculty at Memorial must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have an approved accommodation. This requirement aligns with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador’s Mandatory Vaccination Policy and is subject to change based on changes to the government policy.” In sum, 1G fits vaccinated students with mask and other covid-related health measures still applicable at all levels and 2G fits for unvaccinated MUN students, who cannot enter the post-secondary campus because MUN “aligns with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador’s Mandatory Vaccination Policy”.

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,"Chief Medical Officer still makes weekly updates and advice on COVID-19. keeping this at a level 2 for now.     https://archive.ph/xfM6x",1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,44251,164,86.92,40.74,40.74,17.59,17.59,29.17,29.17,20.62,20.62,44.79,44.79,31.77,31.77,38.28,38.28,33.47,33.47,47.62,47.62,32.74,32.74,40.18,40.18,34.69,34.69,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,46891,187,86.92,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,16.43,16.43,40.63,40.63,29.69,29.69,35.16,35.16,31.12,31.12,42.86,42.86,30.36,30.36,36.61,36.61,31.99,31.99,25.00,25.00

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated. Proof must be submitted at the time of application  All members will be required to complete an ArriveCAN submission for each trip  RABC permit holders can’t use their permit to enter Canada if they have tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 10 days or have symptoms of COVID-19. Returning residents must present themselves at the nearest CBSA port of entry  Permit holders entering Canada are exempt from mandatory randomized testing    https://archive.ph/4RZks",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,,,27.08,27.08,22.40,22.40,24.74,24.74,,,27.38,27.38,22.02,22.02,24.70,24.70,,,25.00,25.00

To qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller to Canada, travellers must have been vaccinated with a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine accepted by the Government of Canada for the purpose of travel at least 14 calendar days before entering Canada.    All testing for air travellers, for both those who qualify as fully vaccinated and partially or unvaccinated people, will be completed outside of airports, either via an in-person appointment at select testing provider locations and pharmacies, or a virtual appointment for a self-swab test. Travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, unless exempt, must continue to test on Day 1 and Day 8 of their mandatory 14-day quarantine.    Moving testing outside of airports will support testing for travellers arriving by air while still being able to monitor and quickly respond to new variants of concern, or changes to the epidemiological situation. Mandatory random testing continues at land border points of entry, with no changes.    Border testing is an important tool in Canada's detection and surveillance of COVID-19 and has been essential in helping us slow the spread of the virus. Data from the testing program are used to understand the current level and trends of importation of COVID-19 into Canada. In addition, these data have and continue to inform the Government of Canada's safe easing of border measures.    Air travellers who qualify as fully vaccinated and who are selected for mandatory random testing, as well as air travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, will receive an email notification within 15 minutes of completing their customs declaration. The email will contain information to help them arrange for their test with a testing provider in their region. Unvaccinated travellers can complete their tests by a virtual appointment or an in-person appointment with the test provider at their store or at select pharmacies and still respect their quarantine requirements.    All travellers must continue to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours before their arrival in Canada, and/or before boarding a cruise ship destined for Canada, with few exceptions. It is the fastest, easiest and most secure way for travellers to show they meet public health requirements. Additional efforts are being undertaken to enhance compliance with ArriveCAN, which is already over 95% for travellers arriving by land and air combined.    All vaccinated travellers who are randomly selected for the border testing surveillance program must complete arrival mandatory testing requirements.    If your arrival test result is positive, you must go into isolation and follow the federal requirement to isolate for 10 days from the date of the test result. Your 10-day isolation is required, even if the isolation requirement is shorter in your province or territory.    Mandatory random testing and information in the ArriveCAN app are necessary tools that help inform public health advice to protect the health and safety of Canadians.    https://archive.ph/rMHRg",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,,,33.33,33.33,28.65,28.65,30.99,30.99,,,34.52,34.52,29.17,29.17,31.85,31.85,,,25.00,25.00

It will give them instructions on isolation and testing … We recommend texting or emailing the link to make sure they always have the most current version.” However, in for some workers in high-risk circumstances, public health or other government-funded entities remain involved.

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.

These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed.

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40105,158,83.02,62.96,62.96,43.52,43.52,53.24,53.24,46.82,46.82,58.85,58.85,47.92,47.92,53.38,53.38,49.78,49.78,61.90,61.90,49.40,49.40,55.65,55.65,51.52,51.52,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT    This appears to be ending on March 12 2022.

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54812,245,85.60,37.04,37.04,17.59,17.59,27.32,27.32,20.39,20.39,38.02,38.02,27.08,27.08,32.55,32.55,28.66,28.66,39.88,39.88,27.38,27.38,33.63,33.63,29.18,29.18,25.00,25.00

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,86599,314,81.64,37.04,37.04,17.59,17.59,27.32,27.32,21.16,21.16,38.02,38.02,27.08,27.08,32.55,32.55,29.09,29.09,39.88,39.88,27.38,27.38,33.63,33.63,29.67,29.67,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,96609,378,86.22,37.04,37.04,17.59,17.59,27.32,27.32,20.27,20.27,38.02,38.02,27.08,27.08,32.55,32.55,28.59,28.59,39.88,39.88,27.38,27.38,33.63,33.63,29.10,29.10,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,101792,421,81.64,37.04,37.04,17.59,17.59,27.32,27.32,21.16,21.16,38.02,38.02,27.08,27.08,32.55,32.55,29.09,29.09,39.88,39.88,27.38,27.38,33.63,33.63,29.67,29.67,25.00,25.00

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated. Proof must be submitted at the time of application  All members will be required to complete an ArriveCAN submission for each trip  RABC permit holders can’t use their permit to enter Canada if they have tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 10 days or have symptoms of COVID-19.

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,6550,17,74.76,67.59,67.59,59.26,59.26,63.42,63.42,61.36,61.36,70.31,70.31,63.54,63.54,66.93,66.93,65.25,65.25,75.00,75.00,67.26,67.26,71.13,71.13,69.21,69.21,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place.

PCR no longer required, but rapid test must be professionally done.     Non vaccinated travellers to Canada are not permitted. Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     Unless you qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller, you cannot enter Canada for reasons such as:  spending time at a seasonal home or cottage  visiting an immediate or extended family member, if age 18 or over  attending a Canadian educational institution as an international student if age 18 or over  childcare for your relatives  a personal or casual visit  air or rail crew, medical worker, transportation, or sports  tourism, fishing, entertainment or leisure    Fully vaccinated travellers:   Options for providing proof of a valid pre-entry test  All travellers 5 years of age or older must provide proof of one of the following accepted types of test results:    Starting February 28: proof of a professionally administered or observed antigen test taken outside of Canada no more than 1 day before your scheduled flight or entry to Canada by land or water  the one day window does not depend on the time of day the test was taken or the time of your flight or entry  for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave or you enter by land any time on Friday, you could provide proof of a negative result from an antigen test taken any time on Thursday, or on Friday  it must be administered or observed by a pharmacy, laboratory, healthcare entity or telehealth service  the test must be authorized for sale or distribution in Canada or in the jurisdiction in which it was obtained  the test must be performed outside of Canada  Proof of a valid negative molecular test taken within 72 hours of your scheduled flight’s departure time to Canada or your entry to Canada by land or water  for example, if your flight is scheduled to leave at 11:00 am on Friday, your test must have been taken any time after 10:59 am on Tuesday  Previous positive molecular test result: you no longer have symptoms and provide proof of a positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before entering Canada. Counting starts the day after your test.  for example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, then January 11 would be the earliest scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada, or the first day you could use it to enter Canada by land or water  if your positive proof is accepted you won’t have to take arrival or Day-8 tests  a positive antigen test result is never a valid test result for boarding a flight or entry to Canada and can’t be used as proof of a previous infection  End of short trip exemption: the pre-entry testing exemption for trips 72 hours or less ended on December 21, 2021.

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT    This appears to be ending on March 12 2022. ",1.00,"Policy continues:     Jan 12, 2022: Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, the Honourable Mary Ng, announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing.    This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,8682,19,76.11,49.07,49.07,29.63,29.63,39.35,39.35,34.27,34.27,53.65,53.65,42.71,42.71,48.18,48.18,45.32,45.32,55.95,55.95,43.45,43.45,49.70,49.70,46.44,46.44,37.50,37.50

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada.

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,"Testing continues to be made available to symptomatic residents, case numbers are no longer being reported daily and residents are no longer required to report positive tests to public health officials.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220412041422/https://www.nthssa.ca/en/covid-testing  https://web.archive.org/web/20220412033752/https://www.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/gnwt-ending-covid-19-public-health-emergency",0.00,"Residents are no longer required to report positive test results to public health officials.

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,"Chief Medical Officer still makes weekly updates and advice on COVID-19. keeping this at a level 2 for now.     https://archive.ph/xfM6x",2.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,"CMO still recommends well fitting face masks in certain situations, and depending on the provincial advice: https://archive.ph/xfM6x ",5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,11286,22,72.41,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,19.25,19.25,33.85,33.85,22.92,22.92,28.38,28.38,25.94,25.94,35.12,35.12,22.62,22.62,28.87,28.87,26.07,26.07,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,11426,22,77.11,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,18.34,18.34,33.85,33.85,22.92,22.92,28.38,28.38,25.42,25.42,35.12,35.12,22.62,22.62,28.87,28.87,25.48,25.48,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,11502,22,72.41,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,19.25,19.25,33.85,33.85,22.92,22.92,28.38,28.38,25.94,25.94,35.12,35.12,22.62,22.62,28.87,28.87,26.07,26.07,25.00,25.00

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated. Proof must be submitted at the time of application  All members will be required to complete an ArriveCAN submission for each trip  RABC permit holders can’t use their permit to enter Canada if they have tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 10 days or have symptoms of COVID-19. Returning residents must present themselves at the nearest CBSA port of entry  Permit holders entering Canada are exempt from mandatory randomized testing    https://archive.ph/4RZks",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,,,21.35,21.35,16.67,16.67,19.01,19.01,,,20.83,20.83,15.48,15.48,18.15,18.15,,,25.00,25.00

To qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller to Canada, travellers must have been vaccinated with a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine accepted by the Government of Canada for the purpose of travel at least 14 calendar days before entering Canada.    All testing for air travellers, for both those who qualify as fully vaccinated and partially or unvaccinated people, will be completed outside of airports, either via an in-person appointment at select testing provider locations and pharmacies, or a virtual appointment for a self-swab test. Travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, unless exempt, must continue to test on Day 1 and Day 8 of their mandatory 14-day quarantine.    Moving testing outside of airports will support testing for travellers arriving by air while still being able to monitor and quickly respond to new variants of concern, or changes to the epidemiological situation. Mandatory random testing continues at land border points of entry, with no changes.    Border testing is an important tool in Canada's detection and surveillance of COVID-19 and has been essential in helping us slow the spread of the virus. Data from the testing program are used to understand the current level and trends of importation of COVID-19 into Canada. In addition, these data have and continue to inform the Government of Canada's safe easing of border measures.    Air travellers who qualify as fully vaccinated and who are selected for mandatory random testing, as well as air travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, will receive an email notification within 15 minutes of completing their customs declaration. The email will contain information to help them arrange for their test with a testing provider in their region. Unvaccinated travellers can complete their tests by a virtual appointment or an in-person appointment with the test provider at their store or at select pharmacies and still respect their quarantine requirements.    All travellers must continue to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours before their arrival in Canada, and/or before boarding a cruise ship destined for Canada, with few exceptions. It is the fastest, easiest and most secure way for travellers to show they meet public health requirements. Additional efforts are being undertaken to enhance compliance with ArriveCAN, which is already over 95% for travellers arriving by land and air combined.    All vaccinated travellers who are randomly selected for the border testing surveillance program must complete arrival mandatory testing requirements.    If your arrival test result is positive, you must go into isolation and follow the federal requirement to isolate for 10 days from the date of the test result. Your 10-day isolation is required, even if the isolation requirement is shorter in your province or territory.    Mandatory random testing and information in the ArriveCAN app are necessary tools that help inform public health advice to protect the health and safety of Canadians.    https://archive.ph/rMHRg",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,,,27.60,27.60,22.92,22.92,25.26,25.26,,,27.98,27.98,22.62,22.62,25.30,25.30,,,25.00,25.00

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,977,4,62.34,87.04,87.04,78.70,78.70,82.87,82.87,81.84,81.84,79.17,79.17,74.48,74.48,76.82,76.82,76.25,76.25,85.12,85.12,79.76,79.76,82.44,82.44,81.78,81.78,37.50,37.50

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1935,5,66.36,72.69,72.69,64.35,64.35,68.52,68.52,67.16,67.16,70.05,70.05,65.36,65.36,67.71,67.71,66.94,66.94,74.70,74.70,69.35,69.35,72.02,72.02,71.15,71.15,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1935,5,66.36,72.69,72.69,64.35,64.35,68.52,68.52,67.16,67.16,70.05,70.05,65.36,65.36,67.71,67.71,66.94,66.94,74.70,74.70,69.35,69.35,72.02,72.02,71.15,71.15,37.50,37.50

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).

Those required to reduce capacity to 50 per cent, such as smaller retail stores, will receive a rebate payment equivalent to 50 per cent of their costs.  Businesses will be required to submit proof of costs associated with property tax and energy bills as part of the application process. All eligible businesses must submit an application to be considered, including those that received previous COVID-19 support payments.     https://archive.vn/6qycN",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,937636,10223,77.53,66.67,66.67,47.22,47.22,56.94,56.94,51.59,51.59,64.58,64.58,53.65,53.65,59.12,59.12,56.11,56.11,68.45,68.45,55.95,55.95,62.20,62.20,58.76,58.76,37.50,37.50

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",1.00,0,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1151090,12397,81.23,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.54,17.54,42.19,42.19,31.25,31.25,36.72,36.72,33.30,33.30,42.86,42.86,30.36,30.36,36.61,36.61,32.71,32.71,37.50,37.50

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

Canada,CAN,Prince Edward Island,CAN_PE,STATE_TOTAL,20220104,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,"All public schools will remain closed until at least 17 Jan 2022:     The Back to School Guidance for January 2022 includes public health measures to minimize risk and disruption and increase safety in schools when students and staff return to in-class learning.     Some measures contained in the CPHO Back to School Guidance for 2022 include:    Masks will be required for all students, teachers and visitors in all indoor areas; children and staff should have access to a good quality three-layer mask.  Prior to resuming class all students and staff members will be asked to take two rapid antigen screening tests, 48 hours apart; students will be tested up to three (3) times per week during the first few weeks of school.  Students and staff must complete daily home active screening for symptoms and should not attend school if they are not feeling well or have symptoms of COVID-19.  Where possible, schools should implement cohorting of students and staff, and cohorts should be 50 or less; cohorting is not required in grades 10-12.  Portable air filters are recommended in classrooms that lack mechanical ventilation.  Physical distancing is recommended in all areas, including staff rooms; students are encouraged to select a small, consistent group of friends to associate with in school and on buses.  All students and staff eligible for vaccination should be fully immunized.  The Department of Education and Lifelong Learning is working with the educational authorities to ensure all of the Back to School Guidance from the CPHO is implemented prior to the return to in-class learning.     175 new portable HEPA filters have been purchased and are being delivered this week to schools that currently rely on natural ventilation. Every classroom and high use area within these 10 schools will be fitted with one of the portable ventilation units. Work is also ongoing to ensure the current mechanical systems are maintained and working efficiently, based on industry standards.    Over the next two weeks all excess furniture will be removed from classrooms to give more space for physical distancing, and 30,000 three-layer reusable masks will be delivered to schools for students and staff before the return to in-class learning.    https://archive.vn/VgKk1",,,2.00,1,1.00,1,1.00,1,,,,2.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,2.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,4.00,1.00,1.00,,1.00,0,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,1366,0,81.55,71.30,71.30,59.26,59.26,65.28,65.28,61.48,61.48,67.19,67.19,60.42,60.42,63.81,63.81,61.67,61.67,71.43,71.43,63.69,63.69,67.56,67.56,65.12,65.12,37.50,37.50

The Wage Rebate for Impacted Industries provides a 25 per cent wage rebate on payroll for businesses of impacted industries, such as full-service restaurants and fitness centers, for the period of January 19 to 31, 2022. To review eligibility criteria and apply, visit: COVID-19 Wage Rebate for Impacted Industries.     The Wage Rebate for Impacted Industries can be used in addition to Federal Government COVID-19 supports. For a list of supports, visit: COVID-19 wage and hiring support for businesses (link is external).    “We know these restrictions create many challenges for Island businesses and their employees. The goal of this program is to help businesses maintain their staff during the public health restrictions. Over the coming days, I encourage all Islanders to support local in any way you can, a small gesture can go a long way for small businesses during these tough times.”    - Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Minister Matthew MacKay  In addition, both the COVID-19 Emergency Payment for Workers and Emergency Income for Self-Employed program have added a new eligibility period extending to January 31, 2022. Individuals who have previously applied for the programs earlier this month may be eligible to apply again. Anyone who received the Emergency Payment for Workers between December 17, 2021 – January 17, 2022, and continues to meet eligibility criteria can now reapply for the second eligibility period that includes January 18, 2022 – January 31, 2022.    The Emergency Payment for Workers program provides a $500 payment to workers and self-employed individuals who have lost income due to the public health restrictions announced since December 17, 2021 and show they have been laid off completely or had their hours reduced by at least 25 per cent. The Emergency Income for Self-Employed provides up to $300 a week for self-employed Islanders who are unable to access federal support programs.    https://archive.vn/g0QBB",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,4170,2,81.94,74.07,74.07,65.74,65.74,69.90,69.90,67.24,67.24,68.75,68.75,64.06,64.06,66.40,66.40,64.91,64.91,73.21,73.21,67.86,67.86,70.54,70.54,68.83,68.83,37.50,37.50

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,8764,12,84.00,67.59,67.59,50.00,50.00,58.79,58.79,52.81,52.81,65.10,65.10,55.21,55.21,60.15,60.15,56.79,56.79,69.05,69.05,57.74,57.74,63.40,63.40,59.55,59.55,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,8764,12,84.00,67.59,67.59,50.00,50.00,58.79,58.79,52.81,52.81,65.10,65.10,55.21,55.21,60.15,60.15,56.79,56.79,69.05,69.05,57.74,57.74,63.40,63.40,59.55,59.55,37.50,37.50

Household close contacts, regardless of vaccination status, are required to isolate for 96 hours following their last contact with the positive case and get tested at a Health PEI clinic on day four.   They can exit isolation with a negative test, provided they do not have symptoms.   They should not visit high risk settings (child care facilities, long term care homes, community care homes, group homes, and other congregate living settings) for 10 days following exposure to the positive case.   Staff members from high risk settings who are identified as household close contacts may return to work if they wear a well-fitted mask and follow protocols.   Children may return to child care facilities after completing the four day isolation.  A non-household contact is an individual who meets the definition of close contacts (face to face, unmasked contact with a positive case for at least 15 minutes) and may include classmates, bus mates, team mates, work colleagues, or those you had lunch with.   Non-household close contacts, regardless of vaccination status, are required to follow enhanced measures for 96 hours after their last exposure to a positive case.   Enhanced measures include:   No isolation  Getting tested on day four at a Health PEI testing clinic  Wearing a well-fitting, three-layer mask when outside the home  Work from home as much as possible  If at work, maintain physical distancing  If symptoms develop, get tested (do not wait for day four)  For 10 days following their last exposure to a positive case they should not visit high risk settings  •    All close contacts (household and non-household) will continue to be contacted directly by positive cases, with the exception of school-aged children under the age of 12 who will be contacted by schools and child care facilities.   •    Those isolating with a positive case (for example, a parent or guardian isolating with a child who is positive) will no longer have to self-isolate as a close contact once the case is recovered.     In family situations where children and parents or guardians are testing positive at different times, which extends the period of isolation, there will also be a change. In these situations, after the first positive case in the household completes their isolation, family members who did not have symptoms or test positive may exit isolation. They will be required to test every four days until the last positive case in the household has finished their isolation. Any family members who develop symptoms should visit a Health PEI clinic to be tested immediately and isolate until they receive a negative result.     The isolation changes all refer to close contacts, there are no changes to isolation requirements for positive cases who are still required to isolate (seven days for fully vaccinated individuals and 10 days for those not fully vaccinated).     “The PEI Vax Pass Program has been effective in reducing transmission, however with Omicron, we are now seeing COVID-19 transmission occur among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The main difference has shown us that those who are unvaccinated have increased risk of severe illness and outcomes, including hospitalization,” said Dr. Morrison. “The Vax Pass was introduced as a time-limited additional measure and it has served its purpose well, however there are still many other layers of protection that remain in place, including masking.”",,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,11696,15,85.62,67.59,67.59,38.89,38.89,53.24,53.24,43.02,43.02,65.10,65.10,46.88,46.88,55.99,55.99,49.50,49.50,69.05,69.05,48.21,48.21,58.63,58.63,51.21,51.21,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT    This appears to be ending on March 12 2022. ",1.00,"Policy continues:     Jan 12, 2022: Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, the Honourable Mary Ng, announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing.    This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,"17 Feb 2022 sees new guidance for elderly care homes.

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada.

Now, we have the equipment and procedures to care for patients in their usual place of care.”    Family physicians and walk-in clinic physicians have been provided access to resources and informed about this change. They are prepared to see patients, both virtually and in-person, as needed.    When to seek care    For people who have COVID or COVID symptoms, it’s important to know when to seek care.   Most cases of COVID-19 are mild, and its symptoms can be safely treated at home without visiting a family doctor’s office. COVID-19 is a virus. Like many viruses, you need to let it run its course.     However, if symptoms do start to get worse, people’s first point of contact should be their family doctor or nurse practitioner. At their discretion, they will either arrange a telephone appointment or see you in person.     If you are immunosuppressed or over the age of 50, consider phoning your doctor or 811 within the first 5 days of your COVID-19 symptoms to see if you may benefit from an antiviral medicine.    There are many things your family doctor can do to help if you have COVID-19, including sending a prescription to your pharmacy to help control your symptoms, or even just offer reassurance and answer your questions.    Those who do not have a family physician may call 811 telehealth services for advice or visit a walk-in clinic. 811 nurses have been trained to ask for “red flag” symptoms over the phone, which may prompt them to refer you to your local emergency room or a walk-in clinic, whichever is more appropriate.    If your symptoms are severe enough you don’t believe you can wait for an appointment with your doctor, it’s time to visit the emergency department of your local hospital. If you do not feel you can travel to the hospital safely on your own, call 911.    Staff at the hospital will make sure you are safely taken in and given the care you need. Please ensure you are wearing a properly fitted mask. Notify staff immediately upon arrival of your COVID-19 diagnosis.    “Seeking the right care for COVID when you need it is an important part of having a safe recovery from the virus,” said Dr. O’Connor. “We’re pleased that this transition back to caring for respiratory illness in physician offices will offer more access to care for Islanders who need it, while avoiding unnecessary trips to the emergency department for people with mild illness.    https://archive.ph/W4hH8  ",,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,23345,16,87.08,58.33,58.33,38.89,38.89,48.61,48.61,41.40,41.40,58.33,58.33,45.31,45.31,51.82,51.82,46.99,46.99,63.10,63.10,48.21,48.21,55.65,55.65,50.13,50.13,25.00,25.00

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status.

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

In addition, effective May 24, children, students and staff are no longer required to conduct regular at home antigen screening tests prior to attending school or child care. For individuals and families who wish to continue regular at home screening, schools and early learning and child care centers will have a supply of tests available. Antigen screening tests are also available through Access PEI sites across the province.    The Chief Public Health Office recommends that children and staff do not attend child care or school if they are feeling unwell. If they are symptomatic, it is recommended that testing is completed at a COVID-19 testing clinic.    “Together, the early learning and child care sector and education system, along with families, students, staff and public health, have worked diligently to protect Island students, families and our communities,” said Dr. Morrison. “We continue to strongly recommend masks in public places across Prince Edward Island.”      The removal of the requirement for rapid tests as screening moves this indicator from a code value of 1 to 0.     https://archive.ph/7jznl",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,2.00,1,0.00,,0.00,,,,4.00,1.00,1.00,,1.00,0,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,37124,33,87.55,37.04,37.04,17.59,17.59,27.32,27.32,20.01,20.01,46.35,46.35,33.33,33.33,39.84,39.84,34.95,34.95,47.62,47.62,32.74,32.74,40.18,40.18,34.59,34.59,37.50,37.50

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,"Vaccines continue to be available to anyone over the age of 5 years in PEI:     https://archive.ph/scUCa    Parents of unvaccinated children between the ages of 5 and 11 years should make an appointment for their children to receive a first dose. In addition to any immediate illness, children are vulnerable to developing long COVID-19 and the long-term health impacts of post-viral illnesses are not yet known. Island children 5 to 11 years of age can receive their COVID-19 vaccine at a Health PEI vaccination clinic (link is external).    Anyone 12 years of age and older can get their primary series of the COVID-19 vaccination, first and second dose, at a Health PEI vaccination clinic (link is external) or at one of the many partner pharmacies across the province. Approximately 48,000 Island residents age 12 and over are now eligible for a first booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Booster doses are being offered at clinics and partner pharmacies. Adolescents 12 to 17 years of age can receive a booster dose six months after completing their primary series of the vaccine, and Islanders 18 years of age and older can receive a booster dose five and half months after completing their primary series.     A second booster dose is now recommended for Islanders 70 years of age and older, those living in long-term and community care facilities, and Indigenous adults 18 years of age and older to provide extended protection against COVID-19. The second booster dose should be administered four to six months after receiving the first booster dose.

However, visitors are not allowed for this group.    All other non-COVID patients in hospital settings may continue to have up to three partners in care, with a maximum of two present at one time.      COVID-positive residents, patients and clients may have three partners in care, but only one can visit at a time wearing full personal protective equipment.    Additional visiting will continue to be considered for compassionate reasons on a case-by-case basis.

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated. Proof must be submitted at the time of application  All members will be required to complete an ArriveCAN submission for each trip  RABC permit holders can’t use their permit to enter Canada if they have tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 10 days or have symptoms of COVID-19. Returning residents must present themselves at the nearest CBSA port of entry  Permit holders entering Canada are exempt from mandatory randomized testing    https://archive.ph/4RZks",,,,,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,25.93,25.93,17.59,17.59,21.76,21.76,,,27.08,27.08,22.40,22.40,24.74,24.74,,,30.95,30.95,25.60,25.60,28.28,28.28,,,,

To qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller to Canada, travellers must have been vaccinated with a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine accepted by the Government of Canada for the purpose of travel at least 14 calendar days before entering Canada.    All testing for air travellers, for both those who qualify as fully vaccinated and partially or unvaccinated people, will be completed outside of airports, either via an in-person appointment at select testing provider locations and pharmacies, or a virtual appointment for a self-swab test. Travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, unless exempt, must continue to test on Day 1 and Day 8 of their mandatory 14-day quarantine.    Moving testing outside of airports will support testing for travellers arriving by air while still being able to monitor and quickly respond to new variants of concern, or changes to the epidemiological situation. Mandatory random testing continues at land border points of entry, with no changes.    Border testing is an important tool in Canada's detection and surveillance of COVID-19 and has been essential in helping us slow the spread of the virus. Data from the testing program are used to understand the current level and trends of importation of COVID-19 into Canada. In addition, these data have and continue to inform the Government of Canada's safe easing of border measures.    Air travellers who qualify as fully vaccinated and who are selected for mandatory random testing, as well as air travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, will receive an email notification within 15 minutes of completing their customs declaration. The email will contain information to help them arrange for their test with a testing provider in their region. Unvaccinated travellers can complete their tests by a virtual appointment or an in-person appointment with the test provider at their store or at select pharmacies and still respect their quarantine requirements.    All travellers must continue to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours before their arrival in Canada, and/or before boarding a cruise ship destined for Canada, with few exceptions. It is the fastest, easiest and most secure way for travellers to show they meet public health requirements. Additional efforts are being undertaken to enhance compliance with ArriveCAN, which is already over 95% for travellers arriving by land and air combined.    All vaccinated travellers who are randomly selected for the border testing surveillance program must complete arrival mandatory testing requirements.    If your arrival test result is positive, you must go into isolation and follow the federal requirement to isolate for 10 days from the date of the test result. Your 10-day isolation is required, even if the isolation requirement is shorter in your province or territory.    Mandatory random testing and information in the ArriveCAN app are necessary tools that help inform public health advice to protect the health and safety of Canadians.    https://archive.ph/rMHRg",,,,,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,,,,25.93,25.93,17.59,17.59,21.76,21.76,,,33.33,33.33,28.65,28.65,30.99,30.99,,,38.10,38.10,32.74,32.74,35.42,35.42,,,,

PCR tests will be reserved for those in high-risk settings such as hospitals, long-term care homes, detention centres and homeless shelters, a senior strategic advisor to Quebec public health said during a technical briefing Tuesday.  Northern and remote communities will also be given priority, said Dr. Marie-France Raynault.  ""If you are not in a place where there is an active outbreak or in an environment at risk, the general population, for all practical purposes, will not have access to PCR tests,"" she said.""We are absolutely overwhelmed by the Omicron wave.""  Nearly 47,000 people underwent a PCR test in Quebec on Tuesday alone, a pace that laboratories and personnel cannot maintain.  ""We have a capacity of about 30,000 tests a day, and last week, for example, we had almost 60,000 tests per day and it's unsustainable,'' said Raynault.   Quebec public health is encouraging people to use rapid tests when possible, and if not, to isolate if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19.",2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,1.00,1,1.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,620190,11732,78.32,77.78,77.78,55.56,55.56,66.67,66.67,60.38,60.38,78.65,78.65,61.98,61.98,70.32,70.32,65.59,65.59,79.17,79.17,60.12,60.12,69.64,69.64,64.25,64.25,75.00,75.00

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed. To better respond to the needs of organizations, the government is increasing the aggregate monthly cap on eligible expenses that can be claimed from $300,000 to $1 million (including amounts claimed by affiliated entities) starting on October 24, 2021.  These COVID-19 programs are extended until May 7, 2022, with the authority to further extend them, through regulation, until July 2, 2022.    https://archive.vn/vU4CD",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,5.00,1,,,,3.00,1,2.00,1,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,122525,1006,75.42,50.00,50.00,30.56,30.56,40.28,40.28,35.34,35.34,53.65,53.65,40.63,40.63,47.14,47.14,43.83,43.83,55.95,55.95,41.07,41.07,48.51,48.51,44.73,44.73,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place.

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",,,,,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,132172,1232,76.42,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,18.47,18.47,33.85,33.85,22.92,22.92,28.38,28.38,25.50,25.50,38.69,38.69,26.19,26.19,32.44,32.44,29.14,29.14,,

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

Masking for Schools  As of February 28, masks are no longer required by public health order in schools. Parents and/or students may choose to continue using masks.

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) updated May 19 2022  Do employers still need to limit exposure to COVID-19 for workers?   Under The Occupational Health and Safety Regulations, 2020, employers must take every reasonable precaution to protect the health and safety of workers.     Do I still require an exposure control plan? Can the Ministry of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety still require me to show an exposure control plan to an officer?     Not all employers are required to have a COVID-19 exposure control plan. Employers must have a competent person conduct a hazard assessment to determine if they are required to develop a COVID-19 exposure control plan for their workplace.     When would a workplace need a COVID-19 exposure control plan?   If a worker is likely to have a greater exposure to an infectious material or organism at work, then section 6-22 of The Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2020, for exposure control plans would apply. Some examples where a plan may still be required could include hospitals, dental offices, police, EMS, firefighters, corrections workers and other workplaces.   For information on how to conduct a hazard assessment to determine if an exposure control plan is required, visit the WorkSafe Saskatchewan website.     Can a worker refuse work because of COVID-19?   Workers have the right to refuse to do any specific job or task which they have reasonable grounds to believe is unusually dangerous.     https://web.archive.org/web/20220520182916/https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-information-for-businesses-and-workers",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,"Public Health Measures  There are currently no COVID-related public health orders in effect.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220520172133/https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/public-health-measures/public-health-orders",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,"Public Health Measures  There are currently no COVID-related public health orders in effect.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220520172133/https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/public-health-measures/public-health-orders",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,"Public Health Measures  There are currently no COVID-related public health orders in effect.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220520180836/https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/public-health-measures",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,"Public Health Measures  There are currently no COVID-related public health orders in effect.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220520180555/https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus",,,2.00,1,0.00,,0.00,,,,4.00,1.00,1.00,,0.00,,"No income support.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220520184150/https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-information-for-businesses-and-workers/support-for-workers",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,"This report provides COVID-19 surveillance information at the provincial and COVID-19 reporting zone levels on a weekly basis.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,,,,,138193,1376,76.75,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,18.41,18.41,39.06,39.06,28.12,28.12,33.59,33.59,30.66,30.66,41.07,41.07,28.57,28.57,34.82,34.82,31.48,31.48,25.00,25.00

Do I still require an exposure control plan? Can the Ministry of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety still require me to show an exposure control plan to an officer?

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.

All residents 50 years and older are eligible to receive a fourth dose (second booster) four months after their last dose.  If you have designated medical conditions affecting your immune system (see table below), you are eligible to receive your fourth dose three months following your third dose.  All individuals 12+ are eligible for a third dose at this time, and all residents 50+ are eligible to receive a fourth dose.  Designated vaccines, including Novavax, and fourth doses for eligible residents of First Nations and Métis communities and the Northern Service Administration District are available by SHA appointment made by calling 1-833-SASKVAX (727-5829) only.  Note that AstraZeneca is no longer available in Saskatchewan as of April 30, 2022.  Booster doses do not need to match your previous two dose COVID-19 vaccinations.

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated. Proof must be submitted at the time of application  All members will be required to complete an ArriveCAN submission for each trip  RABC permit holders can’t use their permit to enter Canada if they have tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 10 days or have symptoms of COVID-19.

Due to widespread transmission in the Yukon, the decision was taken to prioritise PCR testing for those most at risk of severe illness from a COVID-19 infection. Those who will be prioritised include: people who live in communities outside of Whitehorse; front line workers; people and staff in congregate living; the over 50s; pregnant; who have risk factors of severe disease; and the unvaccinated or partly unvaccinated.

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3426,21,80.12,46.30,46.30,26.85,26.85,36.58,36.58,30.72,30.72,51.04,51.04,40.10,40.10,45.57,45.57,42.27,42.27,52.98,52.98,40.48,40.48,46.73,46.73,42.97,42.97,37.50,37.50

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4196,25,76.88,35.19,35.19,24.07,24.07,29.63,29.63,26.64,26.64,41.67,41.67,35.42,35.42,38.54,38.54,36.86,36.86,42.26,42.26,35.12,35.12,38.69,38.69,36.77,36.77,37.50,37.50

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,1.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2681101,31818,77.61,37.04,37.04,17.59,17.59,27.32,27.32,21.94,21.94,30.42,30.42,19.48,19.48,24.95,24.95,21.93,21.93,29.40,29.40,16.90,16.90,23.15,23.15,19.70,19.70,37.50,37.50

This includes securing safe and effective treatments as they become available.    Today, the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister of Public Services and Procurement, announced that the Government of Canada has received an initial shipment of 30,400 treatment courses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 oral antiviral treatment, PAXLOVIDTM, with 120,000 more expected to be delivered between now and the end of March. The treatment received Health Canada regulatory authorization earlier today.    Vaccination and public health measures remain the best way to protect the public against infection and severe disease. However, access to effective, easy-to-use treatments, such as the one produced by Pfizer, could be critical to reducing the severity of COVID-19 in people who become infected.    Distribution to provinces and territories will begin imminently. The Government of Canada is working closely with the provinces and territories to coordinate distribution of treatment courses across the country. The Public Health Agency of Canada met with provincial and territorial officials to discuss deployment based on a per capita basis with adjustments due to shipping requirements from Pfizer.    Canada has secured 1 million courses of the treatment.

Through the Wellness Together Canada online portal, people of all ages across the country can access immediate, free and confidential mental health and substance use supports, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.    Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect the health of Canadians and people around the world. In the fight against COVID-19, it is critical that as many people as possible get vaccinated to help keep themselves and their communities healthy and protect our health care system.      However, we know that certain Canadians have doubts and hesitations about getting vaccinated. Fighting the spread of harmful, false health information is critical to our pandemic response as the spread of misinformation continues to undermine vaccine confidence and can hinder our COVID-19 vaccination efforts.    As such, today, the Minister of Health, the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, announced an additional $14 million investment in the Immunization Partnership Fund (IPF), for projects that address misinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccines used to protect against it. This brings the Government of Canada's total investment in the IPF to $78 million since 2020, of which $45.5 million is dedicated to supporting national, regional and local initiatives.    The reasons for vaccine hesitancy are complex, and investments through the IPF aim to address these factors and close the gap in vaccine hesitancy and uptake through evidence-based, culturally relevant and community-based interventions.    https://archive.vn/tI81B",1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,1.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2916524,33317,78.05,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,18.16,18.16,28.33,28.33,17.40,17.40,22.86,22.86,19.80,19.80,27.02,27.02,14.52,14.52,20.77,20.77,17.26,17.26,37.50,37.50

Vaccinated travellers who meet certain criteria are allowed to enter Canada with permission from the Canadian Border Authority (visa acceptance/approval).     As of December 21, unless specifically exempted, all travellers must take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before arriving in Canada, regardless of how long they were away.    Tests taken in-Canada will no longer be accepted. In other words, the pre-entry test must be performed in a country other than Canada within 72 hours of arrival at the land border or within 72 hours of a scheduled flight departure.  Travellers must either have a negative pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before arriving in Canada or a previous positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before departure to Canada.  Antigen tests, often called “rapid tests” are not accepted.  The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada at this time. Now is not the time to travel.    In British Columbia:    Given the ongoing situation in British Columbia, certain fully vaccinated B.C. residents will not have to take a pre-entry COVID-19 molecular test before coming back to Canada. This refers to residents:    who must travel to the U.S. by land to access or purchase goods or services, and  who are absent from Canada for no more than 24 hours.  The exemption also applies to unvaccinated children under 12 years of age entering with one of their fully vaccinated parents, step-parents, guardians or tutors and a person with a contraindication to vaccination.    Travellers should ensure they are only within the U.S. for the required period to access or purchase goods and services and return to Canada as soon as possible, without any unnecessary stops. Those who attend social visits, events or functions would therefore not be exempt from the pre-arrival testing requirement. Travellers should also continue to follow all local, provincial/territorial and public health guidance including masking in public, and maintaining social distancing.    All travellers must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN.    Those who cross the border to ensure that essential services and economic supply chains continue, including truck drivers, remain exempted from the pre-entry test, quarantine and in-Canada test, but must continue to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN before arriving in Canada.    https://archive.vn/mFBj1    coded as 4/1 because non-vaccinated people are not permitted in to Canada, Vaccinated people are screened to ensure vaccination status.

However, the Government recognizes that some Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Allowance recipients may face lower benefit payments because of the income they received from the CERB and CRB.      As announced in the Economic and Fiscal Update, the Government will provide up to $742.4 million for one-time payments. These payments will alleviate the financial hardship of those seniors who qualified and received CERB and CRB in 2020 but who subsequently saw that they counted as income and impacted their GIS or Allowance benefits. This automatic, one-time payment will support those who saw a loss of GIS or Allowance by compensating them for the full, annualized loss amount. Seniors would not need to take any action to receive the one-time payment.      To ensure that this issue does not reoccur, Canada’s Minister of Seniors, Kamal Khera, introduced Bill C-12 in Parliament today. Bill C-12 would amend the Old Age Security Act to exclude any income received under CERB, CRB, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for the purposes of calculating the amount of GIS and Allowance payable beginning in July 2022.    Source: https://archive.vn/Ozzic    On Friday, December 17, 2021, the targeted COVID-19 support measures received Royal Assent. These measures will ensure that the hardest-hit sectors and those who are most affected by the pandemic will continue to receive the support they need. The government will remain vigilant to ensure businesses have the tools needed to deal with the impacts of the evolving Omicron variant while also supporting a strong economic recovery.    Today, the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of National Revenue, announced further details on these measures including current application periods:    Increasing the subsidy rate for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. The increased rate will help organizations continue to hire back workers and create the additional jobs Canada needs for a full recovery. Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy ended on October 23, 2021, and have been replaced by targeted support to organizations that are still facing significant pandemic-related challenges. Support will be available through two streams:  Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies to, for example, hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, and restaurants, with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 40 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 40 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program, which will provide support through wage and rent subsidies. It will support other organizations that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. Eligible organizations would be required to meet the following two conditions to qualify for this program:  An average monthly revenue reduction of at least 50 per cent over the first 13 claim periods for the CEWS (12-month revenue decline); and  A current-month revenue decline of at least 50 per cent.  Applications for period 22 are now open, covering the period of October 24 to November 20, 2021.  Increasing the monthly cap on eligible rent expenses that can be claimed.

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT",1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,1.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3175654,35561,79.89,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.80,17.80,28.33,28.33,17.40,17.40,22.86,22.86,19.60,19.60,27.02,27.02,14.52,14.52,20.77,20.77,17.03,17.03,37.50,37.50

The Honourable Pablo Rodriguez, Minister of Canadian Heritage, along with Christa Dickenson, Executive Director of Telefilm Canada, announced a second extension of the Short-Term Compensation Fund for Canadian audiovisual productions. While it is encouraging that many productions have already resumed thanks to the Fund’s support, there is still a pressing need for this program, especially as the public health situation continues to evolve.    That’s why Telefilm Canada will continue to provide as much as $150 million in compensation until 2023 to production companies whose filming has been interrupted or abandoned as a result of a COVID-19 diagnosis or outbreak.    Canada has an exceptional and resilient film and television industry. These artists and producers have been particularly affected by production stoppages due to COVID-19. Since the pandemic began in 2020, the Government of Canada has extended the Fund twice in order to respond to the ongoing need for support.    The Fund is a temporary emergency measure to address the lack of insurance coverage in the Canadian film and television production industry. The Government will continue to help support a strong recovery for artists and producers in this important industry. The Fund will end on March 31, 2023, three years after the start of the pandemic. We expect that the audiovisual production industry and insurers will move beyond emergency short-term measures to develop a longer-term solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3193438,35751,80.09,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.76,17.76,28.33,28.33,17.40,17.40,22.86,22.86,19.58,19.58,27.02,27.02,14.52,14.52,20.77,20.77,17.01,17.01,37.50,37.50

This includes securing safe and effective drugs as they become available.    Today the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister of Public Services and Procurement, announced that the government has signed a new conditional agreement with AstraZeneca for 100,000 doses of its antibody therapy, Evusheld, for the prevention (pre-exposure prophylaxis) of COVID-19. The antibody therapy is under review by Health Canada for use in specific high-risk patient populations, such as people who are immunocompromised. Health Canada is currently prioritizing the review of all COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.    Should the therapy receive regulatory approval, initial deliveries would be expected to arrive in Canada within a month of authorization. The Public Health Agency of Canada would then coordinate distribution and delivery schedules with provincial and territorial officials immediately following initial deliveries.

After a thorough and independent scientific review of the evidence, the Department has determined that the vaccine meets Health Canada's stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements, and that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh the potential risks.    This is the first authorized COVID-19 vaccine developed by a Canadian-based company, and the first that uses a plant-based protein technology. Medicago's Covifenz is authorized as a two-dose regimen of 3.75 micrograms per dose, to be administered 21 days apart.    In clinical trials, the vaccine was found to be 71 per cent effective against symptomatic infection and 100 per cent effective against severe disease caused by COVID-19. These studies were conducted while there were multiple variants in circulation. The data suggest efficacy against multiple variants, including Delta. Clinical trials with Covifenz showed efficacy against the Delta and Gamma variants, and data also suggesting efficacy against Alpha, Lambda and Mu variants. While additional confirmatory data are needed, preliminary and exploratory data shows that Covifenz produces neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant.    Health Canada has placed terms and conditions on the authorization. Medicago must continue to provide information to Health Canada on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, including protection against current and emerging variants of concern as soon as it is available    The vaccine is authorized for use in adults 18 to 64 years of age, based on the data that was reviewed by Health Canada. There was limited enrolment of participants older than 65 years of age in the clinical trials because a large proportion of older individuals were already vaccinated. Medicago is currently gathering data in older individuals to support regulatory authorization for this age group.    In keeping with the Department's commitment to openness and transparency, Health Canada is publishing multiple documents related to its decision, including a high-level summary of the evidence it reviewed to support the authorization of the vaccine. More detailed information will be available in the coming weeks, including a detailed scientific summary and the full clinical trial results that support the use of this vaccine.    Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to closely monitor the safety of this vaccine, and will take action if any safety concerns are identified.      https://archive.ph/GO0Zp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3280453,36506,80.84,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.61,17.61,28.33,28.33,17.40,17.40,22.86,22.86,19.49,19.49,27.02,27.02,14.52,14.52,20.77,20.77,16.92,16.92,37.50,37.50

Today, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, announced the federal government’s intention to extend enhanced key support programs to ensure Canadians are protected and workers and businesses continue to get help through ongoing public health restrictions.    Using regulatory authority provided in Bill C-2, the government intends to propose expanding access announced on December 22, 2021 by one month, until March 12, 2022:    Local Lockdown Program: Eligibility would continue to include employers subject to capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more; and the current-month revenue decline threshold requirement would remain at 25 per cent. Eligible employers would receive wage and rent subsidies from 25 per cent up to a maximum of 75 per cent, depending on their degree of revenue loss. The 12-month revenue decline test continues to not be required in order to access this support.  Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit: Eligibility would continue to include workers in regions where capacity-limiting restrictions of 50 per cent or more are in place. This benefit provides $300 a week in income support to eligible workers affected by a COVID-19-related public health lockdown order, and who are either unable to work or have lost 50 per cent or more of their income as a result.  With lower than anticipated accessing of the enhanced COVID worker benefits announced on December 22, 2021, today’s extension is expected to be fully covered by the $4.5 billion Omicron provision announced in the recent 2021 Economic and Fiscal Update.    https://archive.vn/3B2jT    This appears to be ending on March 12 2022. ",1.00,"Policy continues:     Jan 12, 2022: Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, and the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, the Honourable Mary Ng, announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing.    This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.

Announced on March 17 2022: Today, the Government of Canada announced that effective April 1, 2022 at 12:01 AM EDT, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to provide a pre-entry COVID-19 test result to enter Canada by air, land or water. Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.

This is the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized in Canada for use in this younger age group.    Health Canada received an application from Moderna to expand the indication of its Spikevax vaccine on November 16, 2021. The vaccine was initially authorized for use in people 18 years of age and older on December 23, 2020, and subsequently authorized for children 12 to 17 years of age on August 27, 2021.    After a thorough and independent scientific review of the evidence, the Department has determined that the benefits of this vaccine for children between 6 and 11 years of age outweigh the risks. Health Canada has authorized a primary two-dose regimen of 50 micrograms per dose to be administered four weeks apart. This is half of the 100 micrograms primary two-dose regimen authorized for people 12 years of age and older.    The clinical trial showed that the immune response in children 6 to 11 years of age was comparable to the immune response in people 18 to 25 years of age, supporting the vaccine efficacy in this younger age group. No serious adverse events were observed during the trial.    Health Canada has placed terms and conditions requiring Moderna to continue providing information to Health Canada on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this younger age group, including information on protection against current and emerging variants of concern. This will provide the Department with more data from ongoing studies and real-world use to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh any risks, as well as to detect any potential new safety signals in any age group.    In keeping with the Department's commitment to openness and transparency, Health Canada is publishing multiple documents related to this decision, including a high-level summary of the evidence it reviewed.    Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to closely monitor the safety of this vaccine, and will take action if any safety concerns are identified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3396364,37120,81.43,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.50,17.50,31.77,31.77,20.83,20.83,26.30,26.30,22.86,22.86,32.74,32.74,20.24,20.24,26.49,26.49,22.56,22.56,25.00,25.00

Fully vaccinated travellers seeking to arrive in Canada before April 1, 2022, must still have a valid pre-entry test.    As a reminder, travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, may need to take a COVID-19 molecular test on arrival if selected for mandatory random testing. Travellers selected for mandatory random testing are not required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.    For partially or unvaccinated travelers who are currently allowed to travel to Canada, pre-entry testing requirements are not changing. Unless otherwise exempt, all travellers 5 years of age or older who do not qualify as fully vaccinated must continue to provide proof of an accepted type of pre-entry COVID-19 test result:    a valid, negative antigen test, administered or observed by an accredited lab or testing provider, taken outside of Canada no more than one day before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a valid negative molecular test taken no more than 72 hours before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry; or  a previous positive molecular test taken at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before their initially scheduled flight departure time or their arrival at the land border or marine port of entry. It is important to note that positive antigen test results will not be accepted.  All travellers continue to be required to submit their mandatory information in ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) before their arrival in Canada. Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.       https://archive.ph/fLgTG",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3502380,37713,81.76,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.44,17.44,31.77,31.77,20.83,20.83,26.30,26.30,22.83,22.83,32.74,32.74,20.24,20.24,26.49,26.49,22.52,22.52,25.00,25.00

Pre-entry tests will still be required for partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers 12 and older who are currently eligible to travel to Canada. Children under 5 years of age are not required to provide a COVID-19 test result.    Additionally, all fully vaccinated travellers will no longer be required to provide a quarantine plan upon entry. This requirement will also be removed for children aged 5-11 who are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, guardian, or tutor and travellers with a medical contraindication to a COVID-19 vaccine.    Furthermore, fully vaccinated travellers arriving to Canada on or after April 25, 2022, will no longer be federally required to do the following for 14 days after arriving:    mask while in public spaces;  monitor and report if they develop signs or symptoms;  quarantine if another traveller in the same travel group exhibits signs or symptoms or tests positive; and  maintain a list of close contacts and locations visited.  As a reminder, all travellers are still required to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours of their arrival to Canada and/or before boarding a plane or cruise ship destined for Canada, including:    contact and travel information, and  vaccination information and proof of vaccination (if applicable).  Fully vaccinated travellers who do not submit their information into ArriveCAN:    won't be eligible for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption (i.e., they may have to submit a pre-entry test result and suitable quarantine plan, quarantine and undergo testing in Canada);  may face additional delays at the border for public health questioning; and  may be subject to fines or other enforcement action.  All travellers, regardless of vaccination status, must also continue to wear a mask throughout their entire travel journey.    While some federal requirements are being lifted for certain eligible travellers, all travellers entering Canada by air, land or water must adhere to the federal requirements along with those outlined by their province or territory.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, we worked hard to secure life-saving personal protective equipment, invest in our health care system, and ensure everyone could get vaccinated. As we recover from the pandemic, we will continue to strengthen Canada’s capacity to develop and produce made-in-Canada vaccines so we can keep Canadians healthy now and into the future, while creating good jobs.    The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today announced that COVID-19 vaccine developer Moderna will build a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Quebec to deliver made-in-Canada vaccines. When completed, this new facility will be able to produce up to 100 million mRNA vaccine doses annually. It will also create hundreds of good jobs.    Construction is set to start this year and the facility is expected to be operational in 2024 at the earliest, subject to planning and regulatory approvals. In addition to COVID-19 vaccines, the facility is expected to be able to produce vaccines for other respiratory diseases, such as influenza – pending their ongoing development by Moderna and approval by Health Canada.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,"Chief Medical Officer still makes weekly updates and advice on COVID-19. keeping this at a level 2 for now.     https://archive.ph/xfM6x",1.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,"CMO still recommends well fitting face masks in certain situations, and depending on the provincial advice: https://archive.ph/xfM6x ",1.00,1,"The Federal government remains responsible for vaccinations of all Federal inmates, regardless of provincial jurisdictions where federal penitentiaries are located.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,"Workplace rapid testing and screening  The Government of Canada, some provincial/territorial governments and distribution partners are also providing free COVID-19 rapid teststo organizations.

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,"There continues to be no Nationally coordinated contract tracing of COVID-19.     On 17 June 2022, the Government of Canada took the decision to decommission the COVID Alert app - a voluntary application that Canadians could download to received notifications of possible exposures to COVID in Canada.   https://archive.ph/SJbBI    June 17, 2022 | Ottawa, ON | Health Canada    Following a thorough review of COVID Alert, the Government of Canada has decommissioned the application effective today, June 17, 2022. The exposure notification service is disabled and users can delete the app from their devices.    The Government of Canada launched the national exposure notification application on July 31, 2020 – a critical point in the COVID-19 pandemic when cases were on the rise in Canada and around the world. Along with the public health measures in place at the time, COVID Alert provided an additional tool to help limit the spread of the virus.    More than 6.9 million people living in Canada successfully downloaded the app and did their part to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. And over 57,000 users who tested positive for COVID-19 notified others of a possible exposure.    While the pandemic is not over, the decision to decommission COVID Alert comes after careful consideration following discussions with provinces and territories on the ongoing evolution of public health programming that varies in each jurisdiction.    Furthermore, over the last few months, with less PCR testing across Canada, fewer one-time keys (OTK) were being issued and therefore fewer notifications of potential exposures were sent to users resulting in lower app usage.    The public health situation in Canada has improved. Case counts have fallen, and hospitalization and deaths are decreasing across the country. Following a successful vaccination campaign, 32 million (or nearly 90 per cent) of people living in Canada over the age of 12 have been vaccinated against COVID-19 with two doses. Canada also has one of the highest rates of vaccination in the world. We are now better equipped to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce pressure on the health care system.    Vaccination continues to be one of the most effective tools to protect ourselves, those around us, our health care system and our economy. Everyone in Canada is encouraged to keep up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses. The Government of Canada will continue to work with provinces and territories to help even more people living in Canada get the shots for which they are eligible.    We encourage everyone to stay aware of COVID-19 activity in their local area, stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations, including getting booster doses, and continue to take personal precautions including staying home if sick, improving ventilation and continuing to wear masks when with people in shared indoor or crowded spaces.",,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,1.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3926127,41733,82.37,33.33,33.33,13.89,13.89,23.61,23.61,17.32,17.32,26.77,26.77,15.83,15.83,21.30,21.30,17.76,17.76,27.02,27.02,14.52,14.52,20.77,20.77,16.72,16.72,25.00,25.00

This decision is part of a phased approach to gradually resume CBSA services still affected by the temporary measures put in place as a result of COVID-19.    The RABC program is available in parts of northwestern Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, as follows:    from Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  the Canadian shore of Lake Superior;  Cockburn Island;  Sault Ste. Marie (upper lock system); and  Northwest Angle Area  To become an RABC permit holder, individuals will need to submit an application to the CBSA, including proof of vaccination or medical contraindication. As we expect a lot of interest in the program, please be advised that it may take more time than usual to process the applications.    In order to meet the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) requirements, new program conditions have been introduced. Applicants are invited to read these requirements carefully prior to submitting their RABC application, including:    All persons enrolled in RABC with the exception of children under the age of 5, medically-contraindicated travellers, and habitual residents of the Northwest Angle (NWA) who are already exempt from public health measures, are required to be fully vaccinated.

This is the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized in Canada for use in this age group and marks a milestone in Canada’s response to COVID-19.  As a result of this authorization, approximately 1.7 million children are now eligible for vaccination against COVID-19.    Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect our families, communities and ourselves against COVID-19. Evidence indicates that the vaccines used in Canada are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.    Health Canada received an application from Moderna to expand the indication of Spikevax on April 29, 2022. Health Canada initially authorized the vaccine for use in people 18 years of age and older on December 23, 2020, and subsequently authorized for children 12 to 17 years of age on August 27, 2021, and children 6 to 11 years of age on March 17, 2022.    https://archive.ph/ixa40    *Federal prisons/inmates continue to be the only group that the Federal Government actively distributes COVID-19 vaccines to in Canada.   https://archive.ph/823yh",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4018403,43465,82.49,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,15.35,15.35,20.52,20.52,15.83,15.83,18.17,18.17,16.65,16.65,19.88,19.88,14.52,14.52,17.20,17.20,15.46,15.46,25.00,25.00

To qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller to Canada, travellers must have been vaccinated with a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine accepted by the Government of Canada for the purpose of travel at least 14 calendar days before entering Canada.    All testing for air travellers, for both those who qualify as fully vaccinated and partially or unvaccinated people, will be completed outside of airports, either via an in-person appointment at select testing provider locations and pharmacies, or a virtual appointment for a self-swab test. Travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, unless exempt, must continue to test on Day 1 and Day 8 of their mandatory 14-day quarantine.    Moving testing outside of airports will support testing for travellers arriving by air while still being able to monitor and quickly respond to new variants of concern, or changes to the epidemiological situation. Mandatory random testing continues at land border points of entry, with no changes.    Border testing is an important tool in Canada's detection and surveillance of COVID-19 and has been essential in helping us slow the spread of the virus. Data from the testing program are used to understand the current level and trends of importation of COVID-19 into Canada. In addition, these data have and continue to inform the Government of Canada's safe easing of border measures.    Air travellers who qualify as fully vaccinated and who are selected for mandatory random testing, as well as air travellers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated, will receive an email notification within 15 minutes of completing their customs declaration. The email will contain information to help them arrange for their test with a testing provider in their region. Unvaccinated travellers can complete their tests by a virtual appointment or an in-person appointment with the test provider at their store or at select pharmacies and still respect their quarantine requirements.    All travellers must continue to use ArriveCAN (free mobile app or website) to provide mandatory travel information within 72 hours before their arrival in Canada, and/or before boarding a cruise ship destined for Canada, with few exceptions. It is the fastest, easiest and most secure way for travellers to show they meet public health requirements. Additional efforts are being undertaken to enhance compliance with ArriveCAN, which is already over 95% for travellers arriving by land and air combined.    All vaccinated travellers who are randomly selected for the border testing surveillance program must complete arrival mandatory testing requirements.    If your arrival test result is positive, you must go into isolation and follow the federal requirement to isolate for 10 days from the date of the test result. Your 10-day isolation is required, even if the isolation requirement is shorter in your province or territory.    Mandatory random testing and information in the ArriveCAN app are necessary tools that help inform public health advice to protect the health and safety of Canadians.    https://archive.ph/rMHRg",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,0.00,,,,0.00,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,1.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4036848,43573,82.49,22.22,22.22,13.89,13.89,18.06,18.06,15.35,15.35,20.52,20.52,15.83,15.83,18.17,18.17,16.65,16.65,19.88,19.88,14.52,14.52,17.20,17.20,15.46,15.46,25.00,25.00
