The guidance states that 'Post-secondary institutions may resume in-person instruction or blended in-person/online instruction, so long as: a physical distance of two metres is maintained at all times between all individuals who are physically present; the maximum number of people in a room or educational space at one time, with appropriate physical distancing, is 50 people or fewer; if two or more individuals are required to come within two metres of one another for the purpose of instruction, practice, or undertaking examinations, additional protections must be instituted such as engineering controls (barriers or partitions), administrative controls (adapting the activity to minimize or eliminate close contact), or use of PPE by all individuals in close contact.    As Alberta is still in Stage 1 of re-opening, the guidance states that libraries, gyms and indoor recreational facilities, and theatres must still remain closed.     Coded as 3 because as there was no evidence post-secondary institutions re-opened immediately for in-person learning.

The Minister outlined the three scenarios that were mentioned previously with the first scenario seeing near-normal operations resume with students returning to daily in-school classes with some health measures. Under the second scenario, in-school classes would only resume partially with additional health requirements. The third scenario would see at-home learning continue. The decision about which scenarios to follow will be made by the government based on public-health guidance, the minister said, not by local school boards. The government stated that there would still be health restrictions in scenario 1, with students cohorting by class if possible, physical distancing, and staggering of start/end times, recesses/breaks, and lunches.

On April 1st B.C.’s provincial health officer said that she is “not against” the widespread use of non-medical masks as the world grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic. This was phrased as a personal choice and not a full recommendation.     To quote: ""Non-medical cloth masks are your choice during COVID-19. A non-medical cloth mask or face covering, while helpful in containing your own droplets, will not protect you from COVID-19, nor is wearing one required of you if you can keep your safe distance from others. Moreover, using a cloth mask does not give you permission to disregard physical distancing and self-isolation orders. Indeed, these, along with respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene, remain the key proven measures to stop transmission.    Wearing a cloth mask or face covering is a matter of personal choice. It is another tool you can choose, particularly when maintaining that important safe distance can be a challenge.""     On July 23rd, in the face of mounting opposition BC's top doctor said that there were no plans for ‘heavy-handed’ mandatory mask policy (article below).     Only July 29th While other jurisdictions have imposed mandatory mask orders, B.C. has encouraged their use without requiring them.    On June 30, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C.’s level of coronavirus transmission did not necessitate a mask order. Henry said she has been hesitant to order British Columbians to wear masks because doing so is “not a viable option” for some.    The voluntary nature of mask wearing was repeated on Oct 9th: ""The provincial health officer has ruled out a mandatory mask indoor order.    On Thursday, Dr. Bonnie Henry said she continues to advocate voluntary wearing of non-medical masks indoors when it’s hard to socially distance — or on public transit — but she would not order it.""    It was not until October 26th that a clear recommendation to wear masks inside was made.     https://web.archive.org/web/20201113184336/https://globalnews.ca/news/6763036/bc-coronavirus-update-april-1/    https://web.archive.org/web/20201113172529/https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/non-medical-cloth-masks-are-your-choice-during-covid-19    https://web.archive.org/web/20201130211824/https://globalnews.ca/news/7211415/coronavirus-mandatory-masks-bc/    https://web.archive.org/web/20201104124841/https://www.citynews1130.com/2020/07/29/bc-covid-19-masks/    https://web.archive.org/web/20201020032346/https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/covid-19-one-death-and-110-new-cases-as-b-c-passes-10000-case-milestone",0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,"No COVID protection measures for the elderly or care homes were put into place in January 2020.

On Jan 29th 2020 the following statement was issued: The risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time. All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.    It is not necessary for the general public to take special precautions beyond the usual measures recommended to prevent other common respiratory viruses during the winter period. Regular handwashing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and avoiding contact with sick people are important ways to prevent the spread of respiratory illness generally.     https://web.archive.org/web/20200808000358/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0016-000176",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,,,0.00,0.00

An example of this is that on Jan 31 more than 150 Canadians were waiting to be evacuated from China, and the question of quarantines was part of an ongoing discussion on how to best contain the virus – but on Jan 31st the position of B.C.'s provincial health officer was that imposing a quarantine would be unnecessary.      https://web.archive.org/web/20200814060512/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477    https://web.archive.org/web/20200501162559/https://globalnews.ca/news/6444560/bc-health-officials-airport-screening-coronavirus-united-states/    https://web.archive.org/web/20200301161644/https://bc.ctvnews.ca/why-b-c-s-top-doctor-doesn-t-want-to-impose-a-coronavirus-quarantine-1.4792625",0.00,,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,1.00,1,"On January 20, 2020, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer (Dr. Theresa Tam) and Deputy Chief Public  Health Officer (Dr. Howard Njoo) held their first media briefing on the novel coronavirus    https://web.archive.org/web/20201203170514/https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2020/01/government-of-canada-officials-to-hold-a-media-availability-on-a-novel-coronavirus.html",0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,,,4.69,4.69,4.69,4.69,4.69,4.69,,,5.36,5.36,5.36,5.36,5.36,5.36,,,0.00,0.00

Anyone who has travelled to Hubei province should self-isolate for 14 days and contact public health officials for support.     From March 12th anyone who chooses to travel should self-isolate for 14 days.     On March 17th, all persons coming into BC must quarantine for 14 days: until April 8th this was not the case if the international traveller entered into another Canadian province. The act was updated to move from a targetted BC entry needing to quarantine towards a general principle that any entry into Canada within 14 days needed 14 days of self isolation.  As of March 25, 2020 it is mandatory under the Quarantine Act that anyone arriving in British Columbia from outside of Canada self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days upon their arrival.    On April 8th, BC introduced new measures to make sure British Columbians returning home from international destinations have the support they need to self-isolate. The measures, which include a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan, support the provincial health officer’s travel orders and reinforce the federal emergency order under the Quarantine Act requiring people entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days. Effective on April 8 2020, international travellers (including from the United States) coming to the province are required to provide a self-isolation plan before or upon arrival to B.C., regardless of their point of entry to Canada. This document, which can be submitted online or completed in person on arrival, must show that returning travellers have supports in place to safely self-isolate for 14 days.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200208153712/https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/02/07/news/coronavirus-british-columbia    https://web.archive.org/web/20201102082428/http://www.bccdc.ca/resource-gallery/Documents/Guidelines%20and%20Forms/Guidelines%20and%20Manuals/Epid/CD%20Manual/Chapter%201%20-%20CDC/COVID19-Self-isolation-for-contacts-travellers.pdf    https://web.archive.org/web/20201014170151/https://bc.ctvnews.ca/b-c-health-officials-discouraging-all-non-essential-travel-outside-canada-1.4850891    https://web.archive.org/web/20201105090242/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-recommends-against-all-non-essential-travel-outside-canada-as-7-new-cases-of-covid-19-detected-1.5495811    https://web.archive.org/web/20200930053200/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-update-bc-what-you-need-to-know-1.5494135    https://web.archive.org/web/20200414164426/https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/public-safety-and-emergency-services/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/gdx/orders-april-10/pho_class_order_travellers_and_employers_april_10_2020.pdf    https://web.archive.org/web/20200414164426/https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/public-safety-and-emergency-services/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/gdx/orders-april-10/pho_class_order_travellers_and_employers_april_10_2020.pdf    https://web.archive.org/web/20201123171118/http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation    https://web.archive.org/web/20201021081727/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PREM0019-000657    https://web.archive.org/web/20200604090546/https://bc.ctvnews.ca/travelling-into-b-c-from-outside-the-country-you-re-now-legally-required-to-have-a-self-isolation-plan-1.4888283",0.00,,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,1.00,0,,1.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0.00,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,8.33,9.90,9.90,9.90,9.90,9.90,9.90,9.90,9.90,11.31,11.31,11.31,11.31,11.31,11.31,11.31,11.31,0.00,0.00

Much of the relief is dedicated to businesses (as is seen in the articles below and the BC Auditor's report). The narrow measures provided seem to stop being available at the end of August. Business supports continued through the summer.   Three examples include:    1) BC Hydro COVID-19 Relief Fund available from April 1 2020 until June 30 2020. It provided eligible residential and small business customers with three months of financial relief on their BC Hydro bill. In the same period customers who weren't eligible for the COVID-19 Relief Fund, we offered the COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program, which allowed you to defer bill payments or arrange for flexible payment plans with no penalty.      2) The Civil Rights Tribunal recognized that the COVID-19 situation may have limited the ability of respondents to receive or respond to Dispute Notices. In the interest of fairness, the CRT did not process requests for default decisions and orders between March 18 and May 31, 2020.     3) To support people and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Province is introducing a new temporary rental supplement, halting evictions and freezing rents, among other actions.      The new rental supplement will help households by offering up to $500 a month towards their rent, building on federal and provincial financial supports already announced for British Columbians facing financial hardship. The program ended on August 31, 2020.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201021112433/https://www.bchydro.com/news/conservation/2020/covid-19-updates.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201022233654/https:/news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0030-000651    https://web.archive.org/web/20200918125257/https:/civilresolutionbc.ca/covid-19/#default-decisions-and-orders    https://web.archive.org/web/20201022235457/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020FIN0024-000754    https://web.archive.org/web/20201114002329/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0048-000561    https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.bchousing.org/BCTRS",0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,"Zoom collaboration for K-12 Students to stop the spread of COVID 19     https://web.archive.org/web/20201023001628/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0027-000608",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,884,16,0.00,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,62.50,62.50

This expanded testing to priority populations for whom results would change their care or the management of the case:    (a) residents of remote, isolated or Indigenous communities,  (b) people living and working in congregate settings (e.g. correctional facilities),  (c) people who are homeless or have unstable housing,  (d) essential service providers (e.g. first responders), or  (e) returning travellers identified at a point of entry to Canada.    On April 20th 2020 it was announced that the following day testing was to change towards identifying and addressing any new community clusters and outbreaks. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms can now be assessed and tested through a physician, nurse practitioner or a local community collection centre.  There is no longer a requirement to be referred by a health care provider or by calling 8-1-1. If you have no symptoms -- including health care workers, those who are a contact of a confirmed case or a returning traveller -- you do not require a test.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200804185013/https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-canada-british-col/early-testing-helps-canadas-british-columbia-fight-coronavirus-cases-elsewhere-soar-idUKKCN21R3DI    https://web.archive.org/web/20201123204716/http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing/phases-of-covid-19-testing-in-bc    https://web.archive.org/web/20201022230046/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EMBC0020-000729    https://web.archive.org/web/20201120105613/http://www.phsa.ca/staff-resources/covid-19-resources-for-staff/staff-covid-19-testing    https://web.archive.org/web/20201118032721/http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing/testing-information",1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1203,38,0.00,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,63.69,62.50,62.50

This meant symptom-based testing of all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, however mild. testing was changed towards identifying and addressing any new community clusters and outbreaks. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms can now be assessed and tested through a physician, nurse practitioner or a local community collection centre.  There is no longer a requirement to be referred by a health care provider or by calling 8-1-1. If you have no symptoms -- including health care workers, those who are a contact of a confirmed case or a returning traveller -- you do not require a test.    This continues to be the policy as of December 2020, as the article below states ""If an individual has no symptoms, they do not require a test. In B.C., testing is generally not available through the provincial health care system for people without symptoms including routine screening for employment, travel, school, before surgery or for other health procedures. This advice may be different from other provinces or countries. In select situations, such as investigation into an outbreak, people without symptoms may be tested under the direction of a medical health officer or clinician.'.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201123204716/http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing/phases-of-covid-19-testing-in-bc    https://web.archive.org/web/20201122120253/http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing",1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1618,78,0.00,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,69.64,69.64,69.64,69.64,69.64,69.64,69.64,69.64,62.50,62.50

They trace a person’s movements for 48 hours before they noticed symptoms — the current best estimate for when health officials believe a person can start spreading COVID-19. Officials pepper people with questions: Do they work with any high-risk groups like senior citizens? What transportation methods do they use to get around? Who lives in close contact with them? Who are their coworkers? Who are they sleeping with? What stores have they shopped in?    From there, even more inspectors branch out to interview all those contacts, in some cases putting out public pleas for anyone on a certain bus or in a certain store at a certain time to get tested.    Everyone notified must go into quarantine and monitor their symptoms. If any of them test positive — and test results are now available within 24 hours, say officials — the contract tracing process is repeated again for that person’s contacts, expanding the investigative web outward.    Track and trace continues to be comprehensive as of December 2020. As per the article below, COVID-19 cases are tracked by the province's health authorities working in collaboration with public health officials by actively contact tracing cases and their close contacts.    VCH public health follows up directly with every person in our region who tests positive for COVID-19. If a person is a close contact of someone who has a confirmed case of COVID-19, then a member of VCH’s public health team will contact them as well to let them know. Cases and contacts will be asked to self-isolate, so they don’t spread illness to others. Contract tracing helps diagnose people earlier to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19. If you have been identified as a COVID-19 case or close contact, please know that VCH will contact you directly and provide further instructions.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200603025810/https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/covid-19-b-c-ramps-up-contact-tracing-to-track-down-spread-of-coronavirus    https://web.archive.org/web/20201109050813/http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-faqs",0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1618,78,0.00,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,78.70,71.88,71.88,71.88,71.88,71.88,71.88,71.88,71.88,73.21,73.21,73.21,73.21,73.21,73.21,73.21,73.21,62.50,62.50

This has made it easier to communicate between teams and follow up with patients using virtual platforms;  people in self-isolation to communicate with public health officials using chat apps they are most comfortable with, rather than having to learn how to use something new; and  K-12 schools and post-secondary institutions to provide online and digital learning platforms, so students can continue their studies while gatherings of 50 people or more are prohibited.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201023002705/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0040-001016    https://web.archive.org/web/20201021081256/https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020CITZ0010-001019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2573,164,0.00,65.74,65.74,65.74,65.74,65.74,65.74,65.74,65.74,64.58,64.58,64.58,64.58,64.58,64.58,64.58,64.58,64.88,64.88,64.88,64.88,64.88,64.88,64.88,64.88,62.50,62.50

Currently, all ministerial orders made by the solicitor general under the Emergency Program Act (EPA) end immediately at the conclusion of the provincial state of emergency. Specific orders already made will be extended in the legislation after the end of the state of emergency by 45 or 90 days.

This easing across the province found that some regions, particularly remote regions, started discussing targeted restrictions against visitors from outside the community.  Therefore, these phase 3 restrictions gave the general advice not to travel, but allowed the tourism sector to open and receive visitors.

By Jan 11th 2021 two vaccines have been approved: on December 9, 2020 was the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, on December 23, 2020 the Moderna vaccine was authorized for use. Dec. 30 is the first day Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is available for First Nations communities in the province. This is because Dr. Henry states that ""“As soon as [Moderna] arrives, it will be going to a number of remote and isolated First Nations communities that have been identified”. This is because Moderna’s vaccine has “different storage and handling requirements” compared to the Pfizer vaccine, meaning it can be distributed to isolated and remote communities    Vaccination will happen in phases. The first groups to get vaccinated between December and February include:    residents, staff and essential visitors to long-term care and assisted-living residences.  individuals in hospital or community, awaiting a long term care placement.  health care workers providing care for COVID-19 patients in settings like Intensive Care Units, emergency departments, medical/surgical units and paramedics.  remote and isolated First Nations communities.     Clinically vulnerable groups will not be prioritized in the first roll out. Those over 80 years old are expected to get it in the second roll out between  February to March. There is some exception to only key workers getting the vaccine if a person is in hospital and needs to be given long term care placements. As well, remote indigenous communities are in the first wave. Generally though the first roll out is targeted at key workers, or those in a essential caring role, and not along age or underlying conditions.     The amount of supply available to British Columbia is not sufficient for the demand. During a Monday (January 11, 2021) briefing, Dr. Henry asked for patience, adding that the province’s entire supply of the Pfizer vaccine is expected to be used by day’s end.    While B.C.’s Pfizer-BioNTech doses may be used up by end of day Monday, the West Coast is still set to receive 28,275 doses of that vaccine the week of January 11-17 and the two weeks to follow.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210112001231/https://www.citynews1130.com/2020/12/31/first-nations-moderna-vaccine-bc/    https://web.archive.org/save/https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-arrive-bc    https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-arrives-in-remote-first-nations-across-canada-1.5260824",3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,2,,,,,49568,847,0.00,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,60.63,60.63,60.63,60.63,60.63,60.63,60.63,60.63,65.71,65.71,65.71,65.71,65.71,65.71,65.71,65.71,25.00,25.00

As a result, EIA clients who receive the CERB benefit will receive more than they would on EIA alone. They will also continue to receive prescription drug, dental and optical benefits regardless of whether they are still eligible for provincial social assistance.

Blended learning (in-class and online) for grades 9 to 12 where distancing cannot be achieved will continue as per status quo.  Schools must ensure two meters of physical distancing to the greatest extent possible, and adjust classroom space as necessary; excess furniture must be removed from classrooms to create additional space; other spaces within schools must be repurposed to accommodate more distancing (e.g., multipurpose rooms, empty rooms, shared spaces, common areas, and libraries).  Extracurricular activities are only permitted if all learning and distancing requirements have been met. If these activities continue, established guidelines must be followed and, in the case of sports, participants should maintain distance when not active.  Teachers and staff who move across cohorts of students, including substitute teachers, are required to wear medical masks. Medical-grade disposable masks have been issued to all schools. N95 masks are not required.  Indoor choir and the use of wind instruments are not permitted.  All field trips must be postponed or cancelled.  All other public health measures are still in effect.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201129133901/http://www.manitoba.ca/covid19/restartmb/prs/winnipeg/index.html",2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,4.00,0,,,,,4.00,0,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,4.00,0,,,,,4.00,0,,0.00,,,3.00,0,,,,,3.00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4088,50,0.00,65.28,65.28,65.28,65.28,65.28,65.28,65.28,65.28,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,37.50,37.50

Acting on the advice of the chief provincial public health officer, schools have notified families and staff. This change is being made in light of the widespread community transmission of COVID-19.

A total of 19 schools from Hanover School Division are affected, as well as one Division scolaire franco-manitobaine school, one funded independent school and seven non-funded independent schools.  Schools are working to move to a system of remote learning.

Public Health staff interview the positive person to identify public areas they have visited and people they’ve spent time with. These people are contacts. Public Health maintains the privacy of the positive person. Anyone who tests positive can choose to tell others about their diagnosis, but Public Health will not.    Public Health gets in touch with the close contacts and asks them about symptoms of COVID-19. Close contacts with no symptoms are asked to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days after their last contact with the case. Contacts with symptoms are sent for testing. Non-close contacts will be asked to self-monitor.  If a contact tests positive, Public Health will reach out to all their close contacts and restart the process.”  See Government of New Brunswick website, archived:   https://web.archive.org/web/20201222112406/https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/corporate/promo/covid-19/about-covid-19.html",0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,"Effective 23 December, New Brunswick Public Health moved the Edmundston region to the yellow alert level from the more serious orange level.

The School Lunch Association is working on plans to distribute the food supplies they have on hand at schools to food service providers throughout the province. With schools currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Provincial Government is working with both groups to determine the best way to ensure families in the community that need food can get it.

The federal initiative, announced on March 27, provides up to $40,000 in commercial loans to businesses to alleviate unusual financial pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding is provided to qualifying businesses through an application process designed by Export Development Canada and must be made through the business’s primary financial institution.    The Credit Union Regulations, as currently worded, could impact the access for some provincial credit unions to this program which would provide much-needed financial assistance to existing commercial customers, especially small to medium-sized businesses. To support the province’s credit unions and their commercial members, government has amended the Regulations to provide all of the province’s credit unions with the ability to access federal commercial loan programs to help Newfoundland and Labrador businesses deal with the financial impacts from the COVID-19 public health emergency.""    https://web.archive.org/web/20200526161335/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/servicenl/0424n02/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,256,3,0.00,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,62.50,62.50

In support of licensees, which includes lounges, bars and restaurants, effective immediately the NLC will waive liquor license fees for the 2020-21 fiscal year. Also, the NLC will work with the licensee community to return general list product in an effort to help with working capital. The NLC is also temporarily waiving warehousing service fees for microbrewers with annual production of 1,000 hectoliters or less for those who use the NLC’s distribution network.    To further assist the province’s beverage industry, the NLC has been approved to implement a wholesale pricing discount for licensees, by providing a five per cent discount for wines and spirits, and ready to drink beverages.    Additionally, government has approved an increase in product commission discounts for craft breweries, wineries, distilleries and cideries producing 1,000 hectoliters or less to 55 per cent for non-NLC distributed products.    Government has also approved a temporary regulatory change to permit ferment-on premise operations (U-Brew) to bottle beverages for their customers that started batches of wine or beer prior to the COVID-19 health restrictions.    The NLC will further support businesses through its distribution and marketing capabilities by listing products of local microbreweries not already supported in this way.    The NLC also recently announced upgrades in its manufacturing facility, Rock Spirits, to install a canning line. These upgrades will support the NLC’s ability to enter into commercial agreements with local craft producers to can product for those who otherwise would not have this opportunity.    Minister Osborne has also committed to bringing legislation forward that will allow for the temporary direct sale of alcohol to customers by restaurants and other licensed establishments that sell prepared meals for takeout/curbside pick-up and delivery. This legislation will also include changes to allow brewers, wineries and distilleries the ability to offer home delivery.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201128132504/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/fin/0501n02/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,257,3,0.00,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,83.33,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,76.19,62.50,62.50

This credit is expected to vary based on customers’ usage and is made possible due to fuel savings at the Holyrood Thermal Generating Facility. Rather than spread these forecast fuel savings monthly over the next year in the usual manner, government will request that the Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities adopt a policy so that a credit will be disbursed immediately up-front to help people and businesses now when they need it most. The Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities will determine the details of this initiative, including the amount and timing of the credit. As well, for customers who require flexible bill payments, government is providing up to $2.5 million to waive the interest on overdue accounts for residential and general service customers throughout the province.

Interprovincial travel without the requirement to self-isolate will be permitted in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, for residents of Atlantic Canada as of July 3, 2020.

Other Canadian visitors to the Maritime provinces that have self-isolated for 14 days may travel within the Maritime region.    Premiers noted that the decision to ease travel restrictions in the region was guided by the Chief Medical Officers of Health in each province and will continue to be closely monitored. All public health directives present in each province must be adhered to, including not traveling if you have any symptoms of COVID-19 and practicing physical distancing and good hand hygiene.

It features three scenarios based on the risk of COVID-19 throughout the school year.    The first scenario involves schools opening and instruction resuming almost as normal. The second features schools being partially opened, while the third involves full-time at-home learning.    Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, said the scenario chosen in September will be based on where the province stands with the disease at the time.    ""If the epidemiology doesn't support having children back in school, obviously that is something we will consider at the time,"" Fitzgerald said during a technical briefing with reporters on Monday morning.    The first scenario would see students return to normal learning in classrooms, but with public health measures in place, such as physical distancing and sanitizing of surfaces. Classes could be ""cohorted,"" meaning the same students would stay together throughout the day as much as possible to limit the number of interactions between students.    The second scenario could see school populations split up on alternating schedules, meaning some kids would go to school while others stayed home and then vice-versa.    The third scenario would mean all in-school classes are cancelled. Teachers may be required to be in school to support students with learning or behavioural disabilities who need more more support. The rest of the students would be given at-home learning materials.    Education Minister Brian Warr said the decision on which scenario to enact will be on the school districts, in consultation with public health officials in their region.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201129190119/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/education-plan-schools-newfoundland-labrador-july-6-1.5638748",1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,261,3,0.00,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,62.50,62.50

""Today the Honourable Dwight Ball, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Honourable Brian Warr, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, outlined a comprehensive plan for a return to school in September that will enable school districts and parents to plan proactively while prioritizing the safety and well-being of students and school communities.    Current literature notes that children and youth are less susceptible to the risk of COVID-19 and that school closures increase inequalities in learning, particularly for those who are vulnerable. With this in mind, it is critical to balance the risks of returning to school with the impacts on the physical and mental health of students.    The focus of the Newfoundland and Labrador K-12 Education Re-entry Plan is to maximize in-person attendance in the K-12 education system while ensuring health and safety measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission for students, all teaching staff, support workers and families.  The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is following recommendations and the advice of various expert organizations including public health officials both provincially and nationally. The plan offers guidance on a wide range of operational areas including physical distancing measures, hygiene and cleaning protocols, transportation, food services, curriculum outcomes, assessment, and guidance for students with exceptionalities, among others.    School districts will plan for three scenarios for the fall:    Scenario 1: In-school classes resume (near normal with health measures)  Scenario 2: In-school classes partially resume (with additional health measures)  Scenario 3: At-home learning (in-school classes are suspended/cancelled)  The preferred and anticipated scenario is that students will return to daily in-school classes at the beginning of the year. However, school districts are asked to prepare for implementing any of the three possibilities during the upcoming school year, including on short notice. Officials with public health and the department will be monitoring the situation closely and will provide any necessary updates prior to the beginning of the school year.    The re-entry plan balances the need for provincial standardized approaches in some areas while also providing flexibility and recognition of the school districts’ ability to meet health guidelines in the most effective ways in their own communities.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201129190424/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/eecd/0706n01/    ""The Provincial Government today announced it is investing $20 million for the purchase of laptops for all teachers, and Chromebooks for all junior high and high school students across the K-12 education system. The devices will be distributed as they become available through a public procurement process which is underway.    The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how technology is central to education that is learner-centred and accessible from anywhere, allowing for the continuation of teaching and learning when there is an interruption to in-school classes.    The investment will ensure equal access to education so that every student, regardless of their ability, location or socio-economic status, can continue their learning outside of the classroom, while providing teachers with the tools they need to effectively deliver remote instruction.    It will also move the K-12 system toward a true digital learning environment, a cornerstone of both The Way Forward and the Education Action Plan, which includes the expansion of supportive technology across all nine focus areas of the Action Plan, such as inclusion, student mental health and wellness, mathematics and reading.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201129184949/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/eecd/0706n02/",1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,2.00,0,,,,,2.00,0,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,261,3,0.00,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,62.50,62.50

These guidelines are to ensure the health and safety of operators and passengers.    Restrictions on the number of passengers allowed to ride in a taxi remain in place and have not changed. For the safety of drivers and passengers, front seat passengers are not allowed during Alert Level 2. Three passengers are allowed to travel in a minivan, while two passengers are allowed to travel in a sedan.    Drivers may allow members of the same family bubble to ride together.    Taxi operators should continue to encourage users to practice physical distancing of at least two metres from the driver and other passengers, where possible. If physical distancing is not possible, it is strongly recommended that the driver and passengers wear non-medical masks or face coverings.    Taxi operators should also avoid handling money, if possible. Digital and contactless payment methods may help to reduce contact between the driver and passengers. If operators must collect money from passengers, they should immediately clean their hands with an alcohol based hand sanitizer after handling any money.    Taxi operators are also encouraged to continue providing hand sanitizer for passengers to use when they enter the vehicle.    Operators should establish a routine cleaning schedule for all vehicles. Surfaces that have frequent contact with hands should be cleaned and disinfected:    At least twice a day;  When the vehicle is visibly dirty;  After transporting passengers for medical appointments; and,  After transporting passengers who display respiratory symptoms like coughing or sneezing.    Operators should also continue to keep good hand hygiene and physical distancing in mind when refueling the vehicle. After using the gas pump, operators should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer. Payment at the pump or contactless payment methods are encouraged, if possible.    Taxi operators and the public are reminded to stay home if they are sick and avoid contact with others.    Wherever possible, unwell passengers should use a personal mode of transport to reduce the risk of spread.    If an unwell person does need to use a taxi to seek medical attention, they must practice physical distancing from others as much as possible and wear a non-medical mask or face covering to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201129194950/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/health/0717n07/",1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,262,3,0.00,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.06,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,64.29,62.50,62.50

Workers are reminded that testing is free and is covered under MCP.    As announced on Wednesday, September 9 rotational workers from Newfoundland and Labrador who work outside Atlantic Canada in another Canadian province or territory, can call 811 when they arrive home and arrange for COVID-19 testing as early as day five of their 14-day self-isolation period.    Once you call 811, you will be given a telephone number to book an appointment through your regional health authority. You can call to book a testing appointment seven days a week from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.    Once an asymptomatic rotational worker has completed seven days of self-isolation and has received a negative test result for COVID-19, they will no longer be required to self-isolate. These individuals will be required to avoid large crowds and mass gatherings. They will be required to wear a non-medical mask when interacting with other people outside their household bubble.    Rotational workers from Newfoundland and Labrador returning to the province who work outside Atlantic Canada in another Canadian province or territory, who do not want to have a COVID-19 test, will still be required to complete the 14 day self-isolation period.    The public are reminded that these self-isolation and testing guidelines do not apply to international rotational workers because the Government of Canada’s quarantine order is in effect and requires anyone returning to Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201129231743/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/health/0911n06/  ",2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,270,3,0.00,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,62.50,62.50

The COVID-19 Stimulus Program was created to help provide short-term employment and to stimulate economic activity through community projects. The program is targeted at small to medium scale municipal enhancement projects, and COVID-19 municipal upgrades such as repairs, maintenance and minor upgrades to municipal buildings, fire halls, recreation centres, and community property.    One application per community is permitted and approved projects will be based on a 90/10 cost shared ratio with submissions capped at $150,000.    The COVID-19 Stimulus Program encourages municipalities to find opportunities to support health and well-being in infrastructure improvements such as:    Upgrading existing walking trails;  Supporting accessibility, new families and building healthy communities; and  Engaging residents in the revitalization of their communities.  Program guidelines and applications are available online. The deadline to submit an application is December 7, 2020.    The COVID-19 Stimulus Program is in addition to the $27.4 million announced under the Safe Restart Agreement in response to COVID-19. The Federal Government portion of the Safe Restart Agreement is being matched on a 50/50 cost share basis with Provincial Government expenditures retroactive to April 1, 2020.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201123143620/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/eccm/1123n03/",0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,316,4,0.00,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,62.50,62.50

Effective 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, November 25, people arriving in Newfoundland and Labrador from within the Atlantic Bubble will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.    Atlantic Bubble travelers will not have to apply for a travel exemption at this time. If anyone within that group has extenuating circumstances making the 14 days of self-isolation impossible, there will be an option to apply for testing to possibly shorten it. Details of this application process will be rolled out over the next few of days.    Updates on these temporary changes related to the Atlantic Bubble will be provided in two weeks.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201126021912/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/exec/1123n04/    ""The Department of Health and Community Services is advising the public about changes to self-isolation and testing for rotational workers.    Effective Wednesday, November 25, rotational workers from Newfoundland and Labrador who work in Canada and return from a site without an outbreak are now required to wait until day seven of their 14 day self-isolation period to arrange COVID-19 testing.    Once an asymptomatic individual has completed seven days of self-isolation and has received a negative test result, they can visit public places and extended family members. They must wear a mask when interacting with people outside their household bubble. They must not attend mass gatherings or visit crowded spaces. They must not enter a long-term care home, personal care home or assisted living facility for 14 days after they return home, except for exceptional circumstances, such as end of life.    Any adults in a household of a rotational worker are advised that they must wear a mask when interacting with people outside their household bubble for 14 days after the worker returns home. They should avoid mass gatherings and crowded spaces. It is recommended that any adults that reside in a household with a rotational worker in isolation avoid long-term care homes, personal care homes and assisted living facilities, as much as possible.    If the rotational worker or anyone in the household becomes symptomatic, everyone in the household must self-isolate immediately and call 811 to arrange testing.    The public are reminded that this change does not apply to international rotational workers or workers returning from a site with an outbreak. These individuals are required to self-isolate for 14 days on their property. They are unable to leave their property, except to seek medical attention.    Starting Wednesday, November 25, Public Health will be making contact with rotational workers to see if they, or their family, require support in any way during the 14 day self-isolation period and also to provide them with a point of contact for any questions they may have around precautions the family should be taking.""    http://web.archive.org/web/20201123213522/https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/health/1123n10/",4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,316,4,0.00,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.90,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,59.52,62.50,62.50

This is not an outright recommendation to cancel events, but fits better here in C3 than in C4 as there is no number of people suggested.     In addition to keeping two-metres physical distance from others, washing our hands frequently, and covering coughs and sneezes, we can avoid or limit settings and situations that increase our risk of exposure to the virus, remember:    outdoor spaces are better than inside – avoid or limit time in enclosed spaces,  less people are better than more – avoid crowds and large gatherings,  avoiding close contact is best but when you can't keep your two-metre distance, wearing a non-medical mask or face covering can provide an additional layer of protection.   Learn more on how to safely use a non-medical mask or face covering here: COVID-19: How to safely use a non-medical mask or face covering  Non-medical masks may not be ideal for all conditions. Summer can bring extreme heat and humidity in areas of Canada, which can put you at risk for heat-related illness and make breathing difficult. When the weather is hot and humid, it is best to maintain physical distancing outdoors and reserve your non-medical mask for use indoors and short periods when you can't maintain a 2-metre distance from others.  Finally, because COVID-19 activity and precautions are not the same everywhere in the country, be sure to consult with and follow the advice of the local public health authority where you are.     https://archive.ph/AmHEy  ",3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,1.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1061,62,0.00,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,87.50,87.50

Indoor visits at long-term care facilities (1 visitor at a time per resident) no longer require residents or their substitute decision makers to identify and designate a limited number of visitors.  2. Residents of long-term care facilities can now leave the facility for medical appointments when accompanied by family members.  3. Community-based adult day programs can resume with an approved plan that meets public health guidelines.  4. Before-school programs and after-school programs can open with up to 15 children in each group without maintaining a physical distance of two metres (6 feet). Different groups of 15 must maintain physical distance. Programs need to follow the Health Protection Act Order and their sector-specific plans. Sector-specific plans should follow guidance from Public Health.

COVID-19 units in hospitals  2. Emergency departments  3. Critical care units  4. Birth unit and early labour unit at the IWK Health Centre  5. Regional care units    According to the Nova Scotia government, the focus on the Central Zone in December is because the Pfizer vaccine has strict storage, handling and transportation requirements which limits distribution elsewhere in the province. The province also expects to receive shipments of the Moderna vaccine in December 2020. Nova Scotia is expecting a total of 150,000 vaccine doses. The province plans to expand its priority list in the first 3 months of 2021 to include long-term care home residents and staff, seniors who live in the community (starting with those over the age of 80, then over 75, then over 70) and other healthcare workers directly involved in patient care. The province intends to receive enough vaccines to immunize 75% of Nova Scotia residents.    1. Source: https://archive.fo/awtse  2. Source: https://archive.fo/fSgjk  3.

Protect Our Elders: A Community Campaign To Stop The Spread Of COVID-19 This social media campaign encourages NWT residents to share the message that the kindest thing we can do to protect our Elders, and keep our loved ones safe, is to stay home and keep at least 2 meters away from people outside our homes. Community members are encouraged to snap a selfie and submit it (& share it on your social media!) for your messages to be shared along with those of other northerners.

Amendments have been made to form a two-territory travel bubble with Nunavut. ¬† Other amendments include clarification on requirements for those moving to the NWT and traveling within the NWT for work or school. There is also additional clarity for family reunification as a compassionate exemption. ¬† Notice of Future Amendments ¬† Future amendments will also be made to the travel order to allow exemptions for residents of the NWT who are employed as: ¬† Supply chain workers Flight crews Airline employees These workers regularly leave the territory for employment purposes and return in the course of the same day. They have minimal contact with other communities and therefore the need to self-isolate, so long as the right precautions are taken are not necessary. ¬† These situations to date have been handled on a case-by-case. The future amendments would eliminate the need for this burdensome implementation step, and provide clear precautions for these workers to abide by. ¬† Quote(s): ‚ÄúI am pleased that our territory has reached a point where the Chief Public Health Officer feels it is safe to move into phase two of the Emerging Wisely Plan.¬† Reaching new phases is an important part in making sure our territory is moving forward and able to focus efforts on recovery. As we continue to meet these milestones, the GNWT will continue to work together and find ways to support NWT residents and ensure the health and safety of our people, territory and economy are at the forefront of our decisions. - Caroline Cochrane, Premier of the Northwest Territories""",2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,2.00,,2166703.00,"From Gov't NWT on June 12 - 2,944,000 CAD (2,166,703 USD on June 12) ""The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) announced today that it will allocate $2.944 million to airlines and rotary wing operators in the Northwest Territories. ¬† The GNWT is providing this funding directly to airlines and rotary wing operators during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that these companies can continue to provide connections into communities, providing essential goods, like food and medical supplies, through June 30, 2020."" https://archive.fo/4GupQ",0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,0,0.00,67.59,67.59,67.59,67.59,67.59,67.59,67.59,67.59,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,68.75,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,66.07,87.50,87.50

The Education Bulletin highlights different challenges and concerns that could possibly arise in the process of returning to school and throughout the school year, with a focus on what the new learning experience will look like and what new processes with be implemented under the direction of the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO). The Bulletin also outlines specific areas of student support and wellness. Providing support to students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic remains a high priority to ECE, educators and childcare professionals and is a concern that is taken very seriously. Therefore, all students and education staff will be eligible to access counseling services. ¬† Quotes: ‚ÄúAs we begin the 2020-2021 school year, the health, safety and wellbeing of students and educators remains a top priority.¬† We have worked extensively with education bodies and the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer to implement best practices within our plans for re-opening schools that support an effective learning environment as well as the safety of our students, staff and communities.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20201126222045/https://www.gov.nt.ca//en/newsroom/updated-education-bulletin-published-reopening-schools",2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,0,0.00,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,87.50,87.50

During the pandemic, it is crucial we normalize¬† wearing non-medical masks¬† so everyone feels safe and supported when using this important tool in the COVID-19 prevention toolbox.¬† The Public Health Agency of Canada states that when worn properly, a person wearing a non-medical mask or face covering can reduce the spread of his or her own infectious respiratory droplets. Studies suggest that transmission of a respiratory virus from person to person is significantly decreased if both are wearing non-medical masks. The first phase of the campaign, focused on social media advertising will show ordinary people wearing non-medical face masks with explanations about why it is the most important thing they are wearing. Posts will be made on Facebook and Twitter.""",2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,0,0.00,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,60.19,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,58.93,62.50,62.50

Colleges and UPEI remain closed: https://archive.vn/wip/EytX5    The plan includes guidelines for all schools to keep students and staff safe, for example:    Students will work in cohorts, or groups of the same students, as much as possible. Cohorts will distance themselves from other groups to limit exposure to other students.  Classrooms will be configured to support physical distancing. Schools will work to reduce class sizes and when necessary, alternate space such as multi-purpose rooms will be used as classrooms.  Lunch and recess breaks will be staggered, as well as drop-off and pick-up times.  Protocols will be in place to safely move students through the school and reduce congestion in hallways and common areas.  Students and staff will be required to stay home when they are unwell and there will be screening protocols for all people entering a school.  Students will be educated on the importance of physical distancing and hand washing.  Enhanced cleaning protocols will be followed in the school and on the school bus.  To reduce the number of students on buses, parents will be asked to transport their children to and from school whenever possible and buses will be added where necessary.  The plan for September is based on current evidence and recommendations of the Chief Public Health Office. While in-school learning is the preferred model, back-up plans will be in place to move to at-home learning should public health conditions change.  Staff will return to school on September 1 and students on September 8. Orientation on new operational requirements will be held for all staff. Professional learning for teachers will focus on the revised curriculum, online teaching and learning, and student wellness.    https://archive.vn/wip/ajiDY    https://archive.vn/wip/EytX5  ",2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,3.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,1.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27,0,0.00,69.44,69.44,69.44,69.44,69.44,69.44,69.44,69.44,67.19,67.19,67.19,67.19,67.19,67.19,67.19,67.19,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,62.50,100.00,100.00

Islanders who are rotational workers (those who travel frequently or routinely outside the Atlantic Bubble (within Canada), spending at least half of their time working outside of Atlantic Canada), do not need to self-isolate or work-isolate. Instead, rotational workers must be tested on a regular basis, monitor for symptoms and follow public health measures such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing a non-medical mask when physical distancing is not possible. This protocol has been in place since the early onset of the pandemic to balance an acceptable risk of transmission with the need for rotational workers to see their families for the limited time they are home.    Effective October 1, individuals who work outside of the Atlantic Bubble (within Canada) who are required to work outside of their home upon return to PEI can apply to work-isolate, via a self-declaration form that will be available on the provincial website. A letter from the worker’s employer indicating their schedule is required. More information on the work-isolate declaration will be available online early next week.     https://archive.vn/zr1Wg",4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,1.00,1,,,,,1.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57,0,0.00,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,59.38,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,55.36,87.50,87.50

In places with seating, and specifically where no one is talking, people will be expected to stay 1.5 metres away from one another, Dr. Arruda (province's public health director) said. That includes university classrooms and movie theatres.   In larger gathering areas where there is a lot of circulation, including in restaurants, Quebecers will still be expected to keep two metres apart. Arruda strongly recommended wearing a mask or face covering when in these large indoor gatherings.  ""Just as in gatherings in private places, the physical distancing will not be applicable to those people coming from the same household,"" he added.

Quebec fish farmers are an important cog in the wheel of food production. The closure of restaurants and the cessation of fishing activities have had a major impact on Quebec's fish farming industry. This situation has led to a drop in the volume of fish purchased from fish farmers and generated a surplus of inventory. The financial contribution from the Quebec government and the federal government is in the order of $408,000 and $612,000 respectively (CAD). This financial support will therefore make it possible to minimize the fish mortalities related to these surpluses and to limit financial losses by supporting the stocking of public water bodies.

Those tested for Covid-19 would include those with one of the covid symptoms (fever, chills, cough, difficulty breathing, a sore throat or hoarse voice, headache, runny nose or nasal congestion, unexplained vomiting or diarrhoea, fatigue or muscle aches, or loss of smell or taste) who had travelled outside Yukon in the past 14 days or had close contact with anyone who has travelled outside Yukon.     Even if someone does not have travel history but is symptomatic with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, they can be tested for Covid-19 as well.    There will also be greater testing in long-term care facilities and the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter.    However, deciding who is tested is ultimately at the health care providers' discretion.

With the reopening of public pools, there are no more requirements for businesses of any sector to close. However, there remain restrictions on businesses.

The update states that visitors do not need to socially distance within a household whilst they are undergoing 14 days self-isolation if the rest of the household are self-isolating with them. In this scenario, if the visitor in the household leaves Yukon before their 14-day isolation has come to an end, the rest of the household is allowed to end their self-isolation three days after their guest has left, so long as they monitor themselves and check in with their former guest to see if they have Covid-19 symptoms. If neither are symptomatic after three days, the household can end their self-isolation.    If however, while a household's guest is self-isolating, others in the household do not self-isolate themselves, the guest must socially distance at all times from the rest of the household at a distance of two metres.

There are six RDAs across the country (the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, Western Economic Diversification Canada, FedNor, FedDev Ontario, Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency).

This is not an outright recommendation to cancel events, but fits better here in C3 than in C4 as there is no number of people suggested.     In addition to keeping two-metres physical distance from others, washing our hands frequently, and covering coughs and sneezes, we can avoid or limit settings and situations that increase our risk of exposure to the virus, remember:    outdoor spaces are better than inside – avoid or limit time in enclosed spaces,  less people are better than more – avoid crowds and large gatherings,  avoiding close contact is best but when you can't keep your two-metre distance, wearing a non-medical mask or face covering can provide an additional layer of protection.   Learn more on how to safely use a non-medical mask or face covering here: COVID-19: How to safely use a non-medical mask or face covering  Non-medical masks may not be ideal for all conditions. Summer can bring extreme heat and humidity in areas of Canada, which can put you at risk for heat-related illness and make breathing difficult. When the weather is hot and humid, it is best to maintain physical distancing outdoors and reserve your non-medical mask for use indoors and short periods when you can't maintain a 2-metre distance from others.  Finally, because COVID-19 activity and precautions are not the same everywhere in the country, be sure to consult with and follow the advice of the local public health authority where you are.     https://archive.ph/AmHEy  ",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,4.00,,,4.00,,2.00,0,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,2.00,1,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,101341,8838,0.00,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,23.44,23.44,23.44,23.44,23.44,23.44,23.44,23.44,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,37.50,37.50

Each province will determine their own roll-out plan for those categories of peoples. Vaccinations are Government funded.     British Columbia: The first vaccines will be given in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and the Fraser Health region.    The doses are going to people working in long-term care homes and assisted living facilities, as well as those in high-risk environments such as hospital emergency wards and intensive care units (ICU).    Alberta: The first vaccines will be given at the University of Alberta Hospital and Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton, and the Peter Lougheed Centre and the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary.    The doses are going to ICU doctors and nurses, respiratory therapists and long-term care workers.    Saskatchewan: The first vaccines will be given at the Regina General Hospital.    The doses are going to health-care workers in ICUs, emergency and COVID-19 units. Some quantity of the immunization will also go to staff of COVID-19 testing centres as well.    Manitoba: The first vaccines will be given in Winnipeg.    The doses are going to health-care workers most directly involved in COVID-19 response such as those in critical care units, and then to senior citizens in long-term care homes and assisted living facilities.    Ontario: The first vaccines will be given at the Ottawa Hospital and the University Health Network in Toronto.  The doses are going to health-care workers providing care in long-term care homes and other high-risk settings.    Quebec: The first vaccines will be given in Montreal.  The doses are going to residents of a few long-term care homes in the area, followed by health professionals.    New Brunswick: The first vaccines will be given at the Miramichi Regional Hospital.  The doses are going to long-term care residents and staff, health-care workers who respond to COVID-19 outbreaks, extra-mural staff and paramedics, other health-care workers, First Nations nurses, and seniors over 85.    Nova Scotia: The first vaccines will be given in Halifax.  The doses are going to workers in COVID-19 care units, regional care units, and intensive care units that treat COVID-19 patients.    Newfoundland and Labrador: The first vaccines will be given in St. John’s.  It remains unclear who the first vaccines will be given to.    Prince Edward Island: Vaccinations begin on 16 December     The doses are going to priority groups in line with the National Advisory Committee on Immunization’s recommendations, which suggests in no order that vaccines go first to: residents and staff in seniors’ facilities; adults 80 years of age and older; health-care workers with high exposure risks; and Indigenous communities.    The territories: On Wednesday, federal health officials said that due to the Pfizer vaccine’s temperature sensitivity and requirements for advanced cold storage inside a medical facility, the territories will not be receiving any of the initial doses. Territorial leaders have opted to wait for the likely second vaccine to be approved, from Moderna.    https://archive.vn/I7Zm3  https://archive.vn/wip/EumZc",0.00,,,,,,0.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,475836,14303,0.00,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,27.78,20.31,20.31,20.31,20.31,20.31,20.31,20.31,20.31,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,21.43,12.50,12.50
