As before, staff and secondary school students are only required to wear masks for the next five days if someone in a student's household is found infected while primary school students are suggested to do the same. All staff and students must also do a rapid antigen test (RAT) before school for the next five days. However, masks must be worn by any workers supporting students with disabilities in schools and close contact staff or high school students returning to school for the first five days and recommended for primary school students.    School-level outbreaks of COVID-19 may lead to the implementation of several temporary measures such as ceasing large indoor events, symptomatic use of RATs and limiting school visitors but cohosting is still relatively unrestricted. Staff are still required to be vaccinated and students are strongly encouraged to. Schools are still recommended to use outdoor spaces for ventilation or, with winter, having windows and doors slightly open with a heater indoors.

By NSW government restrictions, residents of aged care facilities were only allowed two fully vaccinated visitors aged 12 or over (must have received second dose at least 14 days prior to visit) plus two children under 12 each day. This means that non-vaccinated individuals are not allowed to visit aged care facilities. Visitors are strongly encouraged to have taken the booster shot, receive the 2022 flu vaccine and have a negative RAT result prior to each visit. While indoors, all visitors must wear a facial mask apart from particular circumstances but the visit should take outdoors whenever possible. People providing a service to a resident are not considered visitors. Exemptions can be made to the two-visitor rule if the resident is at end of life, subject to condition that operator of facility takes reasonable steps to ensure that no more than 4 people are allowed to visit at any one time, all visitors are wearing masks and there is minimal interaction between visitors, staff and other residents. Visitors are not allowed entry into an aged care facility if they have COVID-19 symptoms, are a household or close contact, have been overseas in the past 14 days, waiting for COVID-19 test result or have otherwise been exposed to COVID-19 in 7 days prior to visit.    Residents, provided they do not show COVID-19 symptoms and are provided with appropriate personal protective equipment, are allowed to leave the facility but must abide by government guidelines. They are also recommended to get booster shot as soon as possible.    Staff are recommended to take RAT before start of each shift and are required to be fully vaccinated and taken booster shot as well as wear mask inside facility. If they are considered an essential worker, a staff member with only two doses is allowed to keep working.

Quarantine requirements for vaccinated traveller are differ for every state in Australia, and travellers are recommended to check the quarantine, entry testing requirements, and any other arrangements for the state or territory. Fully vaccinated travellers need to provide a negative PCR test.  This represents a continuation of policy response to Covid-19.   https://archive.ph/DdHRZ  https://web.archive.org/web/20220305013840/https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/vaccinated-travellers  https://web.archive.org/web/20220304110011/https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions",1.00,1,"Updated on 25 January, according to NT Government website:  The Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment is available for Territorians who can’t earn an income because they must self-isolate or quarantine for 14 days, or are caring for someone with COVID-19.    The Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment is a lump sum payment of $1,500 to cover the 14-day isolation period.  A person can submit a claim for each 14-day period for which they have been told by a Territory health official to self-isolate and are unable to attend work and earn income.  Only one payment can be made in relation to each eligible 14-day period.  The payment is exempt from all Australian Government means testing and is taxable.  Services Australia is responsible for the service delivery of the Payment. The eligibility criteria is outlined on Services Australia’s website and guidelines are available on GrantConnect.  The cost of the Payment will be shared – the Australian Government is covering the administrative costs and costs for Australian residents and the Northern Territory is covering the cost for temporary visa holders.

All student protection measures and training for staff and visitors must be maintained at all times.    Students of all ages are able to attend school regardless of their vaccination status.

Individuals who had obtained a negative PCR test in the 72 hours before departure were still allowed to enter Tasmania provided that they had fulfilled all other entry requirements, but this was no longer essential. Travellers were generally required to quarantine until they could provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test.  	• However, there were no longer any testing requirements for individuals who had been outside Tasmania for 7 days or fewer - these travellers were required to take a RAT if they were symptomatic of a close contact of someone who had COVID-19.     With the exception of the classification of all Australian jurisdictions as 'high risk', these new rules were a relaxation of existing COVID-19 policy. Other interstate travel directions continued to apply:     According to the Tasmanian Government website (as of 23 December 2021), unvaccinated individuals (including Tasmanian residents, and excluding those with a medical exemption from taking a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as children under 12 years and two months) required approval in order to enter the state. They were only allowed to enter the state at approved ports, take COVID-19 tests on day 5 after arrival, and quarantine for either 5 or 14 days depending on the results of these tests.     All testing requirements for vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers applied to travellers 5 years old and over.     Fully vaccinated travellers who had not been to any high-risk locations in the past 14 days were exempt from all testing and quarantine requirements. Those from low-risk jurisdictions were able to transit at some approved locations in high-risk jurisdictions before entering Tasmania, without being subject to testing and quarantine requirements.     All travellers were required to register on the Tas-e-travel and scan QR codes on arrival.

This new definition came into effect on 1 January 2022, in light of a National Cabinet meeting which attempted to create a more unified set of guidelines for dealing with close contacts.    Individuals with COVID-19 were required to inform their close, social, and work/education contacts that they had been infected. Individuals with COVID-19 were to instruct their close contacts to self-isolate for 7 days, take a RAT on days 1 and 6 of isolation, and take a PCR test if symptomatic.    Those with COVID-19 were required to tell their social contacts to get a PCR test and self-isolate until receiving a negative result if symptomatic. A social contact was defined as an individual who the COVID-19 case had ""15 minutes of face-to-face contact with, or spent 2 hours with, in the same indoor space"".    Workplaces and educational institutions with COVID-19 cases were required to tell employees and students to get a PCR test and self-isolate until receiving a negative result if symptomatic.    These measures likely represented a relaxation of contact tracing efforts, as the narrower close contact definition, and the increased responsibility of COVID-19 cases to inform their contacts of the appropriate testing and isolation requirements, meant that public health officials spent less time communicating with COVID-19 cases and their contacts.

This represented a strengthening of previous directions regarding booster vaccines, which stated that individuals over 18 could receive a booster vaccine five or more months after receiving their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The new directions came in response to advice from ATAGI to shorten the interval between the second dose and the booster dose in order to provide better protection against the Omicron variant of COVID-19.    All other directions regarding the Tasmanian vaccine rollout remained the same:    According to the Tasmanian Government website, COVID-19 vaccines were available, free of charge, for all Tasmanians who were 12 years old and above. The Pfizer (Comirnaty) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccines were available to those 12 years and over, and the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) vaccine was available to those 60 years and over.  As 90.87% of all Tasmanians 12 years old and above had been fully vaccinated as of 23 December 2021, the Tasmanian Government had the capacity to fulfill its universal vaccine policy.    Some immunocompromised individuals could receive a third primary dose of a COVID-19 vaccine 2-6 months after their second dose.

RATs would be free for individuals who were symptomatic or close contacts of a COVID-19 case (as well as those required to take a COVID-19 test under a public health direction), and positive RAT results could be registered online.     In a media release published by the Tasmanian Premier on 6 January 2022, the Premier mentioned that PCR testing would be available for those unable to use a RAT, those who had difficulty interpreting a RAT, and those who were clinically directed to take a PCR test. The Tasmanian Government website (as of 14 January 2022) also stated that PCR tests would be available to those who were unable to take a RAT, or were specifically instructed to take a PCR test. Individuals who obtained a positive RAT result and registered this result were considered to be confirmed COVID-19 cases, and symptomatic individuals who obtained a negative RAT result were advised to either take another RAT or a PCR test.    However, there were mixed messages pertaining to PCR testing eligibility. In a press conference on 7 January 2022, the Tasmanian Premier stated that individuals who were symptomatic or close contacts of a COVID-19 case could either take a RAT or PCR test. In this press conference, he mentioned that Tasmania's PCR testing facilities were all available, and that Tasmanians could arrange to book a test ""if you want"".

This dose was one third of the dose given to those 12 years old and above.    This policy change was a strengthening of existing Tasmanian vaccine policies. All other vaccine directions remained the same:    According to the Tasmanian Government website (as last updated on 4 January 2022), all eligible Tasmanians  were able to get a COVID-19 vaccine free of charge. The Moderna (Spikevax) and Pfizer (Comirnaty) COVID-19 vaccines was available to all individuals 12 years old and above, whilst the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) vaccine was available to those who were 60 years old and above. As 92.90% of all Tasmanians 16 years old and above had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine as of 6 January 2022, it is highly likely that the Tasmanian Government was able to deliver on its universal vaccination policy.    Pfizer and Moderna booster vaccines were also available for those 18 years and above from four months after the second dose of their primary course of COVID-19 vaccination. Severely immunocompromised individuals could also take a third primary dose of a COVID-19 vaccination.

All other internal movement directions issued by the State Government remained the same:     According to the Tasmanian Government website (as last updated 6 January 2022 and 31 December 2021), all inbound travellers were required to register their trip via Tas-e-travel, and scan a QR code upon arrival.     Fully vaccinated travellers who had been to high-risk areas (all Australian states and territories outside of Tasmania) in the past 14 days were required to have a negative RAT taken within 24 hours before departure, or a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure. Travellers who did not have evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken within the required time periods were required to quarantine until receiving a negative test result. Vaccinated travellers who had not been outside Tasmania for more than 7 days were advised to take a RAT if symptomatic. Vaccinated travellers could also transit directly through approved locations within high or extreme risk areas without needing to fulfill testing or quarantine requirements.     Unvaccinated travellers were prohibited from entering Tasmania unless they had received approval to enter for an essential reason. They were also required to have a negative RAT which was taken 24 hours before departure, or a negative PCR test which was taken within 72 hours before departure. Unvaccinated travellers were required to quarantine for up to 14 days after arrival, but could leave quarantine early if the mandatory COVID-19 test they took 5 days after arrival received a negative result.

This framework enabled critical employees in essential business undergoing critical workforce shortages to apply for an exemption from isolation or quarantine requirements if they became close contacts of a COVID-19 case. The framework was available for businesses in the following sectors:   - Day procedures centres included in the Health Services Establishments Act   - Emergency services   - Power, utilities, and essential infrastructure services   - Agriculture and fisheries   - Freight and logistics involved in delivering essential goods   - Major manufacturing, distribution, and critical supply chains related to essential goods   - Correctional and detention facilities   - Essential commercial cleaning services   - Public transport services.     Before registering for the framework, businesses were required to assess the risks of a critical workforce shortage, seek possible alternatives to requesting close contacts to fill the shortage, and implement extra COVID-Safe measures such as increased testing of workers.     This update was a relaxation of existing COVID-19 policy directions. All other workplace restrictions pertaining to COVID-19 remained the same:     According to the Tasmanian Government website (as last updated on 4 January 2022) all businesses were permitted to operate, but were required to adopt measures to meet minimum COVID-19 safety standards as stated in the Direction under Section 16 - COVID-19 Workplace Plans - No.2, and record these in a safety plan. As part of these minimum safety standards, businesses were required to practice 1.5m social distancing or impose a density limit of 1 person per 2 square metres (although exempted workplaces were only required to ensure that the number of individuals in the workplace did not exceed the number specified on their occupancy permits), maintain cleaning and hygiene practices workplace to minimise the spread of COVID-19, train and inform staff and patrons of COVID-safe requirements they must follow in order to minimise transmission, prevent individuals who had COVID-19 symptoms or were known to be under isolation requirements from entering the premises, and collect contact information from individuals entering or leaving the workplace in order to assist with contact tracing efforts.     Masks were also required in indoor spaces. Individuals entering pubs, nightclubs, bars, and some licensed events were required to be fully vaccinated. Other industry-specific COVID-safe guidelines, such as regular COVID-19 testing for those working in quarantine facilities, and the adoption of transmission-based precautions  in healthcare settings were also in place.

Similarly, those who lost income as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, experiencing COVID-19 vaccine side effects within 3 days after being vaccinated, or caring for a dependant who had received the COVID-19 vaccine, could also receive a $250 payment.    Tasmanians who were unable to access the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, and lost income whilst  isolating due to contracting COVID-19, being a close contact of a COVID-19 case, or caring for a dependent who was a COVID-19 case or close contact, could receive the Pandemic Isolation Assistance Grant.

The Federal Government offered the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, a lump sum payment for some eligible individuals who lost income whilst isolating due to contracting COVID-19 or being a close contact of a COVID-19 case.    The Tasmanian Government offered several different assistance grants:    A $250 lump sum payment was offered to Tasmanians who lost income whilst isolating to wait for a PCR test result. This could only be claimed a maximum of once within a 30-day period. The 27 January 2022 version of the Tasmanian Government webpage stated that this PCR test payment could no longer be claimed at the same time as the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, but it is unclear exactly when this new rule was implemented.  Similarly, those who lost income as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, experiencing COVID-19 vaccine side effects within 3 days after being vaccinated, or caring for a dependant who had received the COVID-19 vaccine, could also receive a $250 payment.    Tasmanians who were unable to access the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment, and lost income whilst  isolating due to contracting COVID-19, being a close contact of a COVID-19 case, or caring for a dependent who was a COVID-19 case or close contact, could receive the Pandemic Isolation Assistance Grant. This was a payment of $750 for every 7-day period of isolation, and Tasmanians could receive a total of $1500 if they were required to isolate for 14 days.    Those who lost income as a result of being required to quarantine after entering Tasmania could receive a $750 lump sum payment for each period of up to 7 days that they were in quarantine. This payment could only be claimed a maximum of once within a 30 day period.    Typically, Tasmanians could only be eligible for the aforementioned income support payments if they were unable to access paid sick leave or carers leave entitlements, and were not receiving any other form of Australian Government income support.    The income support measures available between 22 and 29 January 2022 were a continuation of existing relief measures, except for the changes to the PCR test payment, which represented a weakening of income support policy.

Tasmanians were instead asked to utilise existing concession or financial assistance support, seek help from community organisations, or check their local councils if they required debt or contract relief.    Although emergency accommodation was available for homeless families, or those who could not quarantine safely, this was not a form of rent or contract relief. Tasmanian Government relief schemes for residential tenants and landlords had ended by 30 June 2021 or earlier in 2021, with no further schemes made available.

Tasmanians could either take RATs or PCR tests, and one Tasmanian Government webpage stated that COVID-19 PCR testing clinics should be used by individuals who were not able to take a RAT , or were specifically directed to get a PCR test by Public Health. However, in another Tasmanian Government webpage, several drive-through PCR testing clinics did not specify testing requirements or eligibility criteria, stating that individuals could simply turn up to get tested.    Therefore, although it is unclear whether Tasmanians who were symptomatic or close contacts could take a PCR test without fulfilling any other criteria in practice, the PCR testing directions in place between 22 to 29 January 2022 were a continuation of existing policies.

Businesses and workplaces were not listed as exposure sites, and were instead responsible for informing workplace contacts about positive cases, as well as implementing the necessary COVID-safe measures to keep employees safe. They were expected to assist with the contact tracing process by collecting staff or visitor information not provided by the Check In Tas app. However, Public Health would only contact a business if they knew of several cases linked to the business in question.    On 28 January 2022, the Tasmanian Government website was updated to remove a statement which explained that a 'close contact' could include an individual who spent more than 4 hours at the same site, workplace, or venue as a COVID-19 case during a significant transmission event. The new version of the website only stated that a 'close contact' was someone who spent more than 4 hours in a residential setting with a COVID-19 case during their infectious period.    The contact tracing in place between 22 and 29 January 2022 was a continuation of existing measures, although the change in the definition of a close contact represented a relaxation of existing measures, and an indirect reduction of government involvement with potential contacts of COVID-19 cases.

Critical staff working in these industries who were close contacts of a COVID-19 case were not required to quarantine if their business was undergoing a critical workforce shortage and had successfully registered for the framework.    Before registering for the framework, businesses were required to conduct a risk assessment to identify the risks of a critical workforce shortage, seek possible alternatives to requesting close contacts to fill the shortage, understand the minimum number of workers needed to provide their services, ensure that the return of the close contact is necessary and justified, implement extra measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 whilst the close contact is required to work, and establish a process to ensure the employer is aware once the critical shortage has passed and close contacts can resume quarantine or isolation.    Critical workers could only be granted an exemption if they were fully vaccinated, did not have COVID-19 symptoms, had their attendance registered through Worksafe Tasmania, and returned a negative COVID-19 test result each day before work.    This update was a relaxation of existing COVID-19 policy directions. All other workplace restrictions pertaining to COVID-19 remained the same:    The Tasmanian Government website (as last updated on 4 January 2022, and current as of 28 January 2022) stated that business were allowed to operate, but were required to implement measures to meet minimum COVID-19 safety standards and record them in a safety plan. According to the Direction Under Section 16 - Workplace COVID Plan - No.2, these minimum standards included the following:    	- Maintaining a physical distance of 1.5m where possible, or a density limit of 1 person per 2 square limits (unless the workplace was exempt from doing so)  	- Reviewing public health advice regularly in order to find ways to keep the business COVID-safe, as well as training workers to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace, and informing patrons of COVID-related safety measures and restrictions  	- Cleaning and disinfecting the workplace as necessary to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission  	- Preventing individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, or those who are required to quarantine or self-isolate, from entering the business  	- Collecting contact information from individuals entering the workplace for contact tracing purposes (unless exempt from doing so)    Businesses were encouraged to review and update their Workplace COVID Plans as of 20 January 2022.    Masks were required in all indoor spaces and outdoor events attended by more than 1000 patrons, except where an individual had to perform a job that required clear enunciation or mouth visibility.    Unvaccinated patrons (i.e. those who had not received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine at least 2 weeks ago) were prohibited from entering pubs, bars, nightclubs, outdoor events attended by over 500 people where visitors would be drinking while not seated, and indoor events attended by over 250 people where visitors would be drinking whilst not seated. Stadiums, arenas, theatres, cinemas, sporting clubs and community clubs were exempt from this requirement. Unvaccinated individuals were also prohibited from entering residential aged care facilities unless they had tested negative for COVID-19 (see H8 for more details). Evidence of vaccination status could be provided through a COVID-19 digital certificate,   Immunisation History Statement from the Australian Immunisation Register, or a similar document recognised by the Australian Government or Director of Public Health.      Note: Workers were required to be vaccinated at some businesses including quarantine facilities, health care settings, aged care and disability settings, and at licensed settings (such as pubs, clubs, bars, and nightclubs). Individuals working in early childhood education setting were required to have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine from 8 January 2022.

This includes principals, teachers, administration and education support staff, including casual relief teachers (CRTs), pre-service teachers, and Outside School Hours Care staff.   All staff are required to have received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine unless a medical exemption applies.   • Staff required to be vaccinated, but unable to receive their third dose by the nominated deadline because they were recovering from a recent COVID-19 infection, have an additional four months from the end of their isolation period to receive their third dose. Staff should note that following the expiry of their temporary medical exemption, they will have a maximum of two weeks to receive their third dose. Staff should report their COVID-19 infection on eduPay.  • Staff are required to log onto eduPay to record vaccination status or to enter the date of their booking. Employees who do not update their third dose status on eduPay by the appropriate deadline will not be able to work at a school site.   The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) advises that a previous COVID-19 infection is not a contraindication to COVID-19 vaccination, that vaccination can occur after a COVID-19 infection and there is no requirement to delay vaccination after recovery from acute illness.

The Pfizer (Comirnaty) COVID-19 vaccine was available for individuals aged 5 years and above, the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) COVID-19 vaccine was available to individuals aged 60 years and above (or 18-59 year olds who had chosen to take the vaccine after consulting with a healthcare professional), and the Moderna (Spikevax) COVID-19 vaccine was available to individuals 12 years and above.

Booster vaccines were available for individuals aged 16 years and above who had completed their primary course of COVID-19 vaccination at least 3 months ago. 16-17 year olds could take the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine as part of their booster dose, and those aged 18 years and above could either take the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or the Pfizer COVID-19 for their booster shot.
