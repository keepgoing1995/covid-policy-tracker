E.g., in Ontario: “As of December 13, 2021, all staff had to be fully vaccinated to work in long-term care homes, unless they have a valid medical exemption. Visitors will also have to provide proof of all three doses in order to enter a long-term care home once the temporary pause on general visitors is lifted… the province announced it would be banning general visitors in long-term care and will be prohibiting residents from leaving on day absences for social purposes. Two designated caregivers per person may continue to enter the home.” See Yukon government and CTV news websites:   https://web.archive.org/web/20220107182515/https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19-information/long-term-care-visitation-guidelines-covid-19  https://web.archive.org/web/20220107183346/https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-offering-fourth-covid-19-vaccine-dose-to-long-term-care-residents-mandating-booster-for-staff-1.5723637",,,2,"As of 7 january 2022, eligibility continues to be 5 years of age and up in all provinces and territories consistent with national government guidance.

In addition: “NACI [National Advisory Committee on Immunization] recommends that a [third] booster dose of an authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be offered =6 months after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccine series to adults 18- 49 years of age with consideration of jurisdictional and individual risks…Adults who are moderately to severely immunocompromised who have received a three-dose primary series are included in those who may receive a booster dose.

These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, South Korea, The United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay and Vanuatu.    ""Orange"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus is observed in controlled proportions.

These are: Afghanistan, Belarus, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Georgia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Moldova, Montenegro, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Tanzania, Turkey, Ukraine, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe.    All passengers from Red list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding and may be tested again on arrival. Unvaccinated passengers are subject to presentation of ""compelling reasons"" for travel, mandatory antigen testing on arrival, and must quarantine for 10 days under the control of security forces.     Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding.

There is no need to try to contact the outpatient ward. Only those who are experiencing worsening symptoms need to contact the ward.    As before, day zero is the day an individual takes a PCR test, which is positive. Neither a positive at-home test nor a rapid antigen test can be used as a benchmark for day zero.    As previously stated, the amended rules came into force yesterday, regarding quarantine for those who have received a booster dose and are exposed to COVID-19. For emphasis, this applies to everyone who is in quarantine, including those who are in the same place as an infected individual.    It is important to keep in mind that those who do not have to meet the previous conditions of quarantine must nevertheless meet certain conditions (see also below) and take a PCR test on the fifth day from the date of exposure.  We must continue to look after vulnerable groups in society and pursue individual infection control measures as never before.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220110112145/https://www.covid.is/announcements",1,"10/1/2022  You quarantine if:  You've been in a relationship with someone who turned out to be infected.

Your neighbor is infected (for example, in the same stairwell), unless you have been in a lot of contact.  Quarantine ends:  Quarantine can be shortened to 5 days if you go for sampling, otherwise quarantine is 14 days.  You will automatically receive a barcode for the sampling, you do not need to register specifically for it.  A quarantine that takes place in a home where someone is in isolation ends with a negative result from sampling after the isolation has been lifted. Households can then expect a quarantine day longer than isolation lasts. In order to fulfill the conditions for shortening the quarantine to 5 days, there must be a complete separation between the person in isolation and the person in the quarantine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206184014/https://www.covid.is/undirflokkar/sottkvi  ",,,,,2,1,"10/1/2022  Face masks  Face masks must be worn wherever the 2 metre social distancing rule cannot be observed between people who are unrelated.

Categorical classification of countries is no longer valid, effectively lifting travel bans from category C locations, including several African and European countries, and Hong Kong among others. Revised rules mandate inbound passengers to hold proof of completing vaccination if above 18 years old and negative results of a PCR test obtained within 48 hours before departure if older than six years. They must continue to submit a health declaration from online or via the Pass Track mobile application within 48 hours before arrival. Returning Pakistani citizens unable to avail of vaccination due to visa or medical issues, as well as Afghan citizens entering via land borders, are exempt from carrying vaccination certificate. Passengers arriving via direct flights from Europe will undergo an on arrival rapid antigen test (RAT); officials will also administer RAT to 50% of arrivals from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, as well as a random selection of passengers from other countries. Passengers with positive RAT test results must quarantine for 10 days at a government or self-paid facility, those who test positive on the mandatory PCR test on the eighth day must undergo additional quarantine until they return negative result in a PCR test.

Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 occurs primarily through the respiratory droplets of infected people, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings.

Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. While there have been limited reports of airborne transmission outside of health care settings internationally, its role and extent are under further study. MOH will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges.    To reduce the risk of spread, members of public must wear a mask outside the home and observe safe distancing.

The CDC has indicated that there will be additional guidance for more specific settings, including schools, released in the near future. DOH will review and update the community guidance in the PA-HAN accordingly if and when CDC makes any further adjustments. Please note that this is a very fluid situation. We appreciate your patience as we work through these changes together.    https://archive.vn/pEyJ8    Two southeastern Pennsylvania school districts announces school closures due to the coronavirus on the heels of their winter breaks.

Correct use of cloth face coverings or masks helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 and is required when indoors at K-12 facilities for all school personnel, students, and visitors. There are specific exceptions based on age, development, or disability.    The CDC’s order requiring masks on public transportation, regardless of vaccination status, applies to school buses and transportation. Passengers and drivers are required to wear a mask on school buses.     All school personnel, volunteers, visitors, and students must wear cloth face coverings, or an acceptable alternative (e.g., surgical mask or clear face shield with a drape), at school when indoors in accordance with the Secretary of Health’s Mask Order.    Schools should maintain physical distance of three feet or more between students in classroom settings to the degree possible and reasonable, that allows for full-time, in-person learning for all students.     This guidance has been updated on december 17, 2021; In response to recent sports-related outbreaks, the testing requirements for high-risk  sporting activities has been updated to require screening testing of all athletes, coaches, trainers and supporting personnel, regardless of vaccination status.

This ensures that elderly workers can be protected.     Regarding indoor visitation in nursing homes and long term care facilities the safest practice is for patients and visitors to wear source control and physically distance, particularly if either of them are at risk for severe disease or are unvaccinated. If the patient and all their visitor(s) are fully vaccinated, they can choose not to wear source control and to have physical contact. Visitors should wear source control when around other residents or HCP, regardless of vaccination status.
