Visitors will also have to provide proof of all three doses in order to enter a long-term care home once the temporary pause on general visitors is lifted… the province announced it would be banning general visitors in long-term care and will be prohibiting residents from leaving on day absences for social purposes.

Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding. Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.

The following regulations, announced by the Prime Minister on 10 January, take effect as of 14 January:     - When a positive case is detected in a class, parents will no longer be asked to pick up their child immediately, they can wait for the end of the school day.  - When a positive case is detected in a classroom, case contacts aged under 12 years or those aged over 12 who have a complete vaccination schedule will be able to use 3 free self-tests provided by pharmacies, and will no longer have to perform a PCR or antigen test followed by two self-tests).  - Parents will no longer be asked to produce a certificate after each self-test: a single certificate will be requested. Children may not attend school if one of the self-tests is positive.     Additional measures were announced by the Minister of Education, Youth and Sports on 13 January, including:     - the distribution of 5 million FFP2 masks in establishments for staff who feel the need;  - the replenishment of the fund for the purchase of CO2 sensors as much as necessary, so that local authorities can request it even more massively.  - the recruitment of 3,300 more contract workers;  - the use of supplementary lists;  - the recruitment of educational assistants and support staff for school principals.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220114193949/https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/education    ",2,1,,2,1,,2,1,,2,1,,0,,,2,1,,3,,1,1,,0,,,,,,2,1,,3,,1,,,,0,,3,1,,5,1,,3,1,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,69.44,69.44,85.71,85.71,68.75,68.75,75.00,75.00,25.00,25.00

It is important that managers encourage their employees to take care of their health and to stay at home if they experience any illness. Employees with underlying illnesses are particularly at risk from the virus and should, therefore, consult with their superior as to the possibility of working from home as much as possible if that is an option.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220110105656/https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/workplaces   ",1.00,1,"?10/1/2022  Up to 50 people may attend an event if the following criteria is met:    1) All guests are seated and not facing each other  2) 1 meter social distancing between guests  3) All attendees were a mask.  4) Alcoholic beverages are not sold before, during or after event.  5) Guests are asked to remain seated even if an interval is necessary, if at all possible.

There is no need to try to contact the outpatient ward. Only those who are experiencing worsening symptoms need to contact the ward.

As previously stated, the amended rules came into force yesterday, regarding quarantine for those who have received a booster dose and are exposed to COVID-19. For emphasis, this applies to everyone who is in quarantine, including those who are in the same place as an infected individual.    It is important to keep in mind that those who do not have to meet the previous conditions of quarantine must nevertheless meet certain conditions (see also below) and take a PCR test on the fifth day from the date of exposure.  We must continue to look after vulnerable groups in society and pursue individual infection control measures as never before.  https://web.archive.org/web/20220110112145/https://www.covid.is/announcements",1.00,"10/1/2022  You quarantine if:  You've been in a relationship with someone who turned out to be infected.

Your neighbor is infected (for example, in the same stairwell), unless you have been in a lot of contact.  Quarantine ends:  Quarantine can be shortened to 5 days if you go for sampling, otherwise quarantine is 14 days.  You will automatically receive a barcode for the sampling, you do not need to register specifically for it.  A quarantine that takes place in a home where someone is in isolation ends with a negative result from sampling after the isolation has been lifted. Households can then expect a quarantine day longer than isolation lasts. In order to fulfill the conditions for shortening the quarantine to 5 days, there must be a complete separation between the person in isolation and the person in the quarantine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211206184014/https://www.covid.is/undirflokkar/sottkvi  ",,,,,2.00,1,"10/1/2022  Face masks  Face masks must be worn wherever the 2 metre social distancing rule cannot be observed between people who are unrelated.

Categorical classification of countries is no longer valid, effectively lifting travel bans from category C locations, including several African and European countries, and Hong Kong among others. Revised rules mandate inbound passengers to hold proof of completing vaccination if above 18 years old and negative results of a PCR test obtained within 48 hours before departure if older than six years. They must continue to submit a health declaration from online or via the Pass Track mobile application within 48 hours before arrival. Returning Pakistani citizens unable to avail of vaccination due to visa or medical issues, as well as Afghan citizens entering via land borders, are exempt from carrying vaccination certificate. Passengers arriving via direct flights from Europe will undergo an on arrival rapid antigen test (RAT); officials will also administer RAT to 50% of arrivals from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, as well as a random selection of passengers from other countries. Passengers with positive RAT test results must quarantine for 10 days at a government or self-paid facility, those who test positive on the mandatory PCR test on the eighth day must undergo additional quarantine until they return negative result in a PCR test.

Group sizes for gathering and dining at restaurants have been capped at five since November, when Singapore emerged from an outbreak caused by the earlier Delta variant. Mr Wong, who is a co-chair of the multi-ministry task force handling Covid-19, said during a press conference that the present posture would be maintained as he could not imagine the Omicron wave passing before Chinese New Year.""

Indoor compassionate care, essential caregiver, and end-of-life visitation and outdoor visitation can be permitted even when indoor visitation is otherwise restricted because of the facility's status.    Indoor visitation should be limited for residents under quarantine, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, until they have met criteria for release from quarantine.    In addition, indoor visitation should also be limited for residents with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, until they have met the criteria to discontinue precautions.    When a new case of COVID-19 among residents or staff is identified, a facility should immediately begin testing and suspend visitation (except as required under federal disability rights law and Department guidance/directives) until at least one round of facility-wide testing is completed.""

A trained interviewer will reach out to the person who has tested positive and ask for the contact information of close contacts (A close contact is a person who has been within 6 feet, for 15 minutes or more, of someone who tested positive for COVID-19). Next, the interviewer will reach out to the contacts to let them know they have been exposed. Contacts stay home to watch for symptoms for 14 days after they were exposed.

Because of a steep increase in disease transmission in Washington, the Secretary of Health is requiring that everyone five years of age and older wear a mask in public indoor settings and at large, outdoor events with 500 or more attendees. There are some exceptions to the mask requirement, including:  > Children under five years of age. However, children age two to four years old can wear a mask under close adult supervision.   > People with a medical or mental health condition or disability that prevents them from wearing a mask.   > Anyone who is working alone, regardless of vaccination status.  > Verified fully vaccinated workers who are working in an area not accessible to the public.   > Athletes who play indoor sports and who are actively engaged in competition or practice (masks are still required on sidelines and in team meetings).   > Small indoor private gatherings and outdoor events with fewer than 500 people, where physical distancing is possible.

Governor Jay Inslee issued Proclamation 20-46.3 (pdf) April 8, 2021, amending Proclamation 20-05 (pdf), which prevents all employers, public or private, from failing to provide accommodation to high-risk employees, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that protects them from risk of exposure to the COVID-19 disease on the job. This ensures that elderly workers can be protected.     Regarding indoor visitation in nursing homes and long term care facilities the safest practice is for patients and visitors to wear source control and physically distance, particularly if either of them are at risk for severe disease or are unvaccinated. If the patient and all their visitor(s) are fully vaccinated, they can choose not to wear source control and to have physical contact. Visitors should wear source control when around other residents or HCP, regardless of vaccination status.
