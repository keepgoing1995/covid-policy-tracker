This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,424322,3367,54.63,54.63,67.86,67.86,55.73,55.73,58.33,58.33,37.50,37.50

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1036,4,75.93,75.93,80.95,80.95,72.92,72.92,77.98,77.98,37.50,37.50

This extension will support short-term economic recovery and offer greater repayment flexibility to small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, many of which are facing continued challenges due to the pandemic. Repayment on or before the new deadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the value of the loans (meaning up to $20,000).    Outstanding loans would subsequently convert to two-year term loans with interest of 5 per cent per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with the loans fully due by December 31, 2025.    The government is also announcing that the repayment deadline to qualify for partial forgiveness for CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund is extended to December 31, 2023.    https://archive.vn/YsBQ9",,,,,2.00,1,,1.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,3.00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,906031,10445,63.89,63.89,71.43,71.43,63.02,63.02,66.67,66.67,37.50,37.50

Some measures contained in the CPHO Back to School Guidance for 2022 include:    Masks will be required for all students, teachers and visitors in all indoor areas; children and staff should have access to a good quality three-layer mask.  Prior to resuming class all students and staff members will be asked to take two rapid antigen screening tests, 48 hours apart; students will be tested up to three (3) times per week during the first few weeks of school.  Students and staff must complete daily home active screening for symptoms and should not attend school if they are not feeling well or have symptoms of COVID-19.  Where possible, schools should implement cohorting of students and staff, and cohorts should be 50 or less; cohorting is not required in grades 10-12.  Portable air filters are recommended in classrooms that lack mechanical ventilation.  Physical distancing is recommended in all areas, including staff rooms; students are encouraged to select a small, consistent group of friends to associate with in school and on buses.  All students and staff eligible for vaccination should be fully immunized.  The Department of Education and Lifelong Learning is working with the educational authorities to ensure all of the Back to School Guidance from the CPHO is implemented prior to the return to in-class learning.     175 new portable HEPA filters have been purchased and are being delivered this week to schools that currently rely on natural ventilation. Every classroom and high use area within these 10 schools will be fitted with one of the portable ventilation units. Work is also ongoing to ensure the current mechanical systems are maintained and working efficiently, based on industry standards.    Over the next two weeks all excess furniture will be removed from classrooms to give more space for physical distancing, and 30,000 three-layer reusable masks will be delivered to schools for students and staff before the return to in-class learning.    https://archive.vn/VgKk1",1.00,1,,2.00,1,"the previously announced restrictions remain in place until at least 17 Jan 2022:     The extended public health measures include:     Personal gatherings limited to 10 steady contacts plus household, the smaller the better.

These are the countries of the European area, to which are added Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, South Korea, The United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Taiwan, Uruguay and Vanuatu.    ""Orange"" countries/territories: countries/territories in which active circulation of the virus is observed in controlled proportions. These are all countries/territories not included in the lists of ""green"" and ""red"" countries/territories. Reinforced measures are in force for travel between France and the United Kingdom. The Travel Advice sheet for the United Kingdom should be consulted.

These are: Afghanistan, Belarus, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Georgia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Moldova, Montenegro, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Tanzania, Turkey, Ukraine, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe.    All passengers from Red list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding and may be tested again on arrival. Unvaccinated passengers are subject to presentation of ""compelling reasons"" for travel, mandatory antigen testing on arrival, and must quarantine for 10 days under the control of security forces.     Passengers from Orange list countries must present negative results of a PCR or antigen test taken in the previous 48 hours at boarding. Vaccinated passengers are not subject to the ""compelling reasons"" regime, but unvaccinated people are and must commit to self-isolation lasting 7 days and undergo testing at the end of this period.     Although an Orange list country, additional regulations apply to all passengers aged 12 or over arriving from the United Kingdom:     - subject to the list of ""compelling reasons""  - must present a negative PCR or antigenic (TAG) test taken less than 24 hours before the flight on boarding ;  - must register before departure on the eOS-COVID digital platform  ;  - may be tested antigen on arrival ;  - will be subject to mandatory isolation for 10 days,supervised and controlled by the security forces.

Attendances at football and rugby matches had been limited to 500 people under rules which were introduced as cases of the Omicron variant surged across the country.    Large outdoor events can resume without physical distancing or capacity limits from 00:01 on Monday 17 January, following a review of all measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).    To support the lifting of capacity limits on outdoor events, COVID certification will remain for these where more than 4,000 standing or 10,000 seated are in attendance, and all other events and venues previously covered. Organisers of all events with more than 1,000 attendees will be expected to check a minimum of 50% of attendees for certification of vaccination, exemption, or negative test.    Due to requirements to present certification the coding remains at a 2 level coding    http://web.archive.org/web/20220121133524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53166816    http://web.archive.org/web/20220117091635/https://www.gov.scot/news/large-outdoor-events-resume-from-17-january/",0.00,,"Large outdoor events can resume without physical distancing or capacity limits from 00:01 on Monday 17 January      http://web.archive.org/web/20220121133524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53166816    http://web.archive.org/web/20220117091635/https://www.gov.scot/news/large-outdoor-events-resume-from-17-january/",0.00,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,2.00,,0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,3.00,,1.00,,,,0.00,,3.00,1,,5.00,1,,2.00,1,"Proof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.    http://web.archive.org/web/20220121133524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53166816",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1105671,10062,38.89,38.89,53.57,53.57,49.48,49.48,52.98,52.98,25.00,25.00

There is no need to try to contact the outpatient ward. Only those who are experiencing worsening symptoms need to contact the ward.

PCR-tests are used by the health care system to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, and when people might be infected. Rapid antigen tests are also used in the health care system and by certified test centers, both before events, but also at the beginning and end of special precaution. Self-tests people can buy in stores are not deemed reliable. A postitive result should always be confirmed with a PCR test.    Information on centres for COVID-19 PCR or rapid antigen tests  PCR-test - Symptom testing:  If you have symptoms or suspect you have an infection, you should be tested even if you have been vaccinated.  Stay at home and register immediately for testing on My Page at Heilsuvera. If you do not have an electronic ID, you can contact, by telephone, your local healthcare centre, Læknavaktin 1700 (the on-call medical hotline) or the Heilsuvera online chat. If you have not been in contact with someone infected you are not obliged to islolate until a negative test result is obtained. However it is important to be mindful of social distancing and handwashing and to use a mask if it is nessessary to be around others. You should not, under any circumstances, visit your healthcare centre, the LSH Emergency Unit or Læknavaktin if you have symptoms, without calling first and receiving advice.  PCR-tests are also used for shortened quarantine. See below.  The symptoms may seem minor but it is still important to be tested, no matter how small they seem.  Symptom testing is always free of charge, for tourists as well.  Rapid antigen test - testing for asymptomatic people  Rapid antigen tests are used to screen for COVID-19 virus with asymptomatic people. If you suspect you have an infection, you should have a PCR-test.  Self-tests  Self-tests are not deemed reliable.

Categorical classification of countries is no longer valid, effectively lifting travel bans from category C locations, including several African and European countries, and Hong Kong among others. Revised rules mandate inbound passengers to hold proof of completing vaccination if above 18 years old and negative results of a PCR test obtained within 48 hours before departure if older than six years. They must continue to submit a health declaration from online or via the Pass Track mobile application within 48 hours before arrival. Returning Pakistani citizens unable to avail of vaccination due to visa or medical issues, as well as Afghan citizens entering via land borders, are exempt from carrying vaccination certificate. Passengers arriving via direct flights from Europe will undergo an on arrival rapid antigen test (RAT); officials will also administer RAT to 50% of arrivals from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, as well as a random selection of passengers from other countries. Passengers with positive RAT test results must quarantine for 10 days at a government or self-paid facility, those who test positive on the mandatory PCR test on the eighth day must undergo additional quarantine until they return negative result in a PCR test.

Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. While there have been limited reports of airborne transmission outside of health care settings internationally, its role and extent are under further study. MOH will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges.    To reduce the risk of spread, members of public must wear a mask outside the home and observe safe distancing.

The stabilisation phase, which started on Sep 27 to help reduce the strain on the healthcare system, was scheduled to last until Oct 24.   It has now been extended until Nov 21, with a review of the measures at the two-week mark. They may be adjusted based on the situation then, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.

The stabilisation phase, which started on Sep 27 to help reduce the strain on the healthcare system, was scheduled to last until Oct 24.   It has now been extended until Nov 21, with a review of the measures at the two-week mark. They may be adjusted based on the situation then, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  During the stabilisation phase, social gatherings and dining-in have been capped at groups of two, while work-from-home has been the default arrangement.  Given the extended restrictions, the Government will continue with the Jobs Support Scheme until Nov 21, at 25 per cent wage support for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures.  These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums and art galleries, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, as well as performing arts and arts education.  A two-week rental waiver will be given to qualifying tenants on government-owned commercial properties.  Eligible tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS).  Cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or operators appointed by NEA will receive a 0.5-month rental waiver.

These respiratory droplets can reach the eyes, nose or mouth of a susceptible person directly or indirectly (via contaminated surfaces), resulting in infection.  Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. While there have been limited reports of airborne transmission outside of health care settings internationally, its role and extent are under further study. MOH will continue to monitor the evidence as it emerges.  To reduce the risk of spread, members of public must wear a mask outside the home and observe safe distancing. Individuals should also observe good hand hygiene and avoid crowded spaces if possible.""""

When it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least 3 feet, such as when schools cannot fully re-open while maintaining these distances, it is especially important to layer multiple prevention strategies, such as screening testing.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211129080726/https://dph.georgia.gov/dph-covid-19-guidance",0.00,,"On 21 October 2021, Governor Kemp ordered the renewal of State of Emergency for Continued COVID-19 Economic Recovery.

The updated guidance is closely aligned with new CDC guidance for schools.   1. Students and staff who test positive for COVID-19 or have COVID-19 symptoms should isolate for five days regardless of their vaccination status. They can return to school when all the following conditions are met:    - Five full days have passed since symptoms first appeared or since test was conducted.    - No fever for 24 hours.    - Symptoms have improved.  2. Students and staff who have been in close contact with a person who has COVID-19 should quarantine for five days after last contact if:    - They have not completed their primary vaccine series (2 shots Pfizer or Moderna, 1 shot J&J).    - They are 18 or older and have completed their primary vaccine series but have not received a recommended booster when eligible.  Students and staff should get tested on day five of quarantine, even if they do not have symptoms.  3. Students and staff are not required to quarantine if:    - They are ages 5-17 and have completed their primary series of COVID-19 vaccines (2 shots Pfizer or Moderna).    - They are 18 and older and have received all recommended vaccine doses including boosters.    In addition, everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is required to wear well-fitting masks in all indoor settings and in outdoor settings where crowding may occur. Masks may be removed when actively eating and drinking and during nap time for young children.    Moreover, the updated Guidance for Schools continues to provide multiple mitigation strategies to help solw the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and maintain safe school environments and operations.
